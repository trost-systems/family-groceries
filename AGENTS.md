# family-groceries

Shared shopping list for one household (Peter and Lea). Flutter app (iOS,
Android, web) on Supabase (Postgres + RLS, Auth, Realtime, Edge Functions).
The product spec is [`docs/SPEC.md`](docs/SPEC.md); decisions and their
reasons are in [`docs/DECISIONS.md`](docs/DECISIONS.md).

## Layout

- `app/`: the Flutter app. `lib/list/` is the list feature (model, cubit,
  repository, screen), `lib/session/` auth and household state,
  `lib/household/` onboarding and invites, `lib/app/` router, environment
  and app shell. UI strings live in `app/l10n/app_de.arb` (German template).
- `supabase/`: `config.toml` for the local stack, `migrations/`, pgTAP tests
  in `tests/`, Deno edge functions in `functions/` (`_shared/` for helpers).
- `e2e/`: Playwright tests that drive the Flutter web build against the local
  stack.
- `analytics/`: the PostHog gate insights as HogQL (`queries/`), a TypeScript
  reference over fixture events that the functions gate tests, and the manual
  proofs. The app's side is `app/lib/analytics/` (consent, allow-list,
  sender), the functions' `supabase/functions/_shared/telemetry.ts`
  (`docs/ANALYTICS.md`).
- `app/fastlane/`, `.github/workflows/release.yml`: TestFlight and Play
  internal releases after every green CI on `main` (and by hand), signing
  from secrets (`docs/RELEASE.md`).
- `vercel.json`, `scripts/vercel.sh`: Vercel builds the web app on every push
  (`scripts/vercel-local.sh` runs the same build in Vercel's base image).
  `main` goes to `preview.app.hummlist.com` (Vercel login); `app.hummlist.com`
  moves only when a dispatched `release.yml` run ships a store release and
  pushes the `release` branch (`docs/DEPLOY.md`, section "Web app").
  `supabase-deploy.yml` deploys migrations (`supabase/deploy/`, Management
  API) and edge functions (`--use-api`) from main, then runs
  `scripts/smoke-remote.sh`; its `ref` input rolls functions back.
  `keepalive.yml` reads through `health` daily so the free project doesn't
  pause. Runbook: `docs/DEPLOY.md`.
- `site/`: the public guides site on hummlist.com, its own Vercel project
  (Root Directory `site`), static HTML from Markdown in `site/content/`;
  `site/README.md` explains adding a guide. Separate from the app's build.
  Production hides content tagged `since:` a version above the live one:
  the newest public release in `releases/releases.json` (the public release
  record, `releases/README.md`), else `app/pubspec.yaml`.
  `public-release-record.yml` (`scripts/release/record.mjs`) appends a
  release there and pushes it to main, which redeploys the site.
  `/de/changelog` and `/en/changelog` list the public releases' changelogs
  (job 39, `docs/CHANGELOG.md`): `scripts/release/changelog.mjs` collects
  them from the PRs' `## Changelog` notes into `releases/changelog/<v>.json`
  drafts with the store "What's new" texts; `record.mjs` moves a draft into
  the record.
- `mcp-proxy/`: the Vercel project `hummlist-mcp`, rewrites only, serving the
  `mcp` function at `https://mcp.hummlist.com`. `scripts/mcp-smoke.sh <url>`
  checks MCP discovery on either URL (`docs/MCP.md`).
- `supabase/functions/voice/`: the Siri and in-app dictation endpoint; the
  German sentence splitter is `parse.ts`, its table of sentences
  `parse_test.ts` (`docs/SIRI_SHORTCUT.md` for the Shortcut).
- `supabase/functions/alexa/`: the Alexa skill's endpoint (request verification, intents,
  read-back); the skill package (manifest, de-DE model) is `alexa/skill-package/`. Local requests
  are signed with `scripts/alexa-test-ca.sh`'s test CA (`scripts/alexa-say.sh`, `docs/ALEXA.md`).
- `scripts/`: `bootstrap.sh` (toolchain), `dev.sh` (local stack + web dev
  server), `gates/<gate>.sh` (one per CI job), `verify.sh` (runs the gates
  locally), `lint.sh` (the lint rules below, run by the lint gate),
  `push-pr.sh` and `merge-pr.sh` (push and land a PR as one commit with the
  required author and trailers). `docs/CI.md` explains CI.

## Conventions

- Prove behavior with the verify-family-groceries skill
  (`.cursor/skills/verify-family-groceries/`, also `.claude/skills/`): it
  drives the real app through `scripts/fg` (start with `scripts/fg help`)
  and keeps one recipe per feature in `features/`. A PR that changes a
  feature updates its `features/<feature>.md`. Test accounts in a known
  state come from `scripts/fg seed <scenario>` (`test/fixtures/scenarios/`,
  removed with `fg teardown <run>`), multi-client sync proofs from
  `scripts/fg sync` (`docs/TEST_FIXTURES.md`).
- Run `scripts/verify.sh` before pushing. It runs the same
  `scripts/gates/<gate>.sh` scripts the CI jobs run (gitleaks, lint, changelog, site,
  db, functions, fg-cli, flutter, web-prod, fastlane, e2e); `--only <gate>` runs
  some, `--only e2e -- <spec>` one spec. A check goes into a gate script,
  never into `ci.yml` or `verify.sh` (`scripts/check-gates.sh` fails
  otherwise). The e2e gate holds the box-wide lock `/tmp/fg-e2e.lock`, so a
  second run waits instead of overlapping.
- No Docker here (the Mac runner), or sparing the box: `scripts/ci-e2e.sh
  [--spec "<playwright args>"] [--no-db]` runs the e2e and db gates on
  GitHub Actions for the pushed branch and prints the result (`docs/CI.md`,
  On-demand e2e).
- Public repo: never commit secrets. Only the project URL and the publishable
  key may appear in code. gitleaks runs as a pre-commit hook
  (`.githooks/pre-commit`) and as a required CI job.
- Lints follow emotely: `flutter_agent_lints` (experimental set), every rule
  an error. Fix the code, not the rule; `dart fix --apply` handles most
  primary-constructor and style findings.
- Build-time defines are read only in `app/lib/app/environment.dart`.
- Auth gating happens only in `authRedirect` (`app/lib/app/router.dart`).
- Every household-owned table carries `household_id` and the RLS policy
  `is_household_member(household_id)`. A new table gets the same policy and a
  cross-household case in `supabase/tests/rls.test.sql`.
- Item writes from the app are idempotent ops (`ItemOp` in
  `app/lib/list/model.dart`) applied optimistically and retried until the
  server acknowledges them; the screen shows server rows with pending ops
  folded on top. Add new mutations as new `ItemOp` variants.
- Analytics events pass the allow-list in `app/lib/analytics/events.dart`
  (`eventCatalog`): a new event or property gets a rule there, a test and a
  row in `docs/ANALYTICS.md`. Never list text, names or free text.
- Categorization runs server-side in `public.classify_item(household, name)`
  (called by the items insert trigger). The app, MCP and Siri all go through
  it; change the function, not the callers. Spelling variants, synonyms
  (`supabase/classifier/synonyms.tsv`) and typos are its job too; the shared
  key for them is `items.canonical_key` (job 32a).
- Flutter web e2e: semantics are enabled on web, so Playwright finds widgets
  by role and label. Type with `typeInto` (`e2e/tests/helpers.ts`); synthetic
  key events drop umlauts. A snackbar with an action (undo) keeps its text in
  a group's aria-label: find it with `actionSnackBar`, since `getByText`
  only hits the screen-reader announcement, which the engine soon clears.
- Every PR description has a `## Changelog` section: items (`new`,
  `improved` or `fixed`, then a `de:` and an `en:` sentence in user words)
  or just `none` when users see no change (`docs/CHANGELOG.md`, the PR
  template). push-pr.sh adds `none` for PRs that change neither the app nor
  `supabase/` or `alexa/`, and stops the others without one; the
  `changelog` gate checks the structure.
- `main` takes one commit per PR with `ci-ok` green. To land a PR:
  1. Push the branch once (`git push -u origin HEAD`) and `gh pr create`.
  2. From then on push only with `scripts/push-pr.sh`, fix rounds included.
     It rebases onto `origin/main` and pushes the one commit main takes
     (subject `<PR title> (#n)`, noreply author, trailers). The pre-push
     hook warns when a PR branch goes up as several commits.
  3. Under the merge lock: `scripts/merge-pr.sh --wait <n>` waits for
     `ci-ok` on that commit and rebase-merges it. One CI run per merge.
  If main moved since your push, merge-pr.sh says so: rerun
  `scripts/push-pr.sh` (one more rebase, push and CI run), then merge-pr.sh.
  The old way still works: merge-pr.sh on a multi-commit PR squashes,
  force-pushes and exits 2; rerun it after `ci-ok`, at the cost of a second
  CI run. GitHub's own squash merge authors the commit with the account's
  default email and rejects the noreply address, hence the scripts.

## Lint rules

`scripts/lint.sh` runs these locally and in CI, and each error names the fix.
Rules live in `ast-grep/rules/` with tests in `ast-grep/tests/`, the schema
guards in `supabase/checks/schema_check.ts`. Silence one finding only on the
line above it, with the reason: `// ast-grep-ignore: <rule-id> -- <reason>` or
`-- squawk-ignore <rule> -- <reason>`.

| Rule | What fails | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `no-from-environment` | `String/bool/int.fromEnvironment` outside `app/lib/app/environment.dart` | One inventory of build-time defines |
| `dispose-after-dialog` | A local controller or FocusNode disposed after `await showDialog`/`showModalBottomSheet` (or a picker or pushed route), or in its `.then` | The route still animates out with it; the join dialog crashed (fixed in 1177b52) |
| `shared-preferences-only-in-device-cache`, `device-cache-own-file` | A shared-preferences store outside `DeviceCache`, or one without its own Linux file | A second store on supabase's file signed Linux users out (c4ed2e4) |
| `auth-navigation-only-in-router` | The `/login` or `/welcome` route named outside `router.dart` (path, `loginPath`, `goNamed('login')`) | Auth gating happens only in `authRedirect` |
| `no-hardcoded-ui-text` | A string literal with letters in `Text(...)` or a `label`/`tooltip`/`hintText`-style argument in `app/lib`, also through a same-file constant, list, map, getter or function | UI text lives in `app/l10n/app_de.arb` |
| `purchases-flutter-only-in-revenuecat-repository` | Importing `package:purchases_flutter` anywhere in `app/` but `app/lib/purchases/revenuecat_repository.dart` | One file configures RevenueCat, lazily and with the household id only (Legal Review K.9.9 C3) |
| `no-revenuecat-customer-data` | `Purchases.set*`, `collectDeviceIdentifiers`, `enableAdServices*`, `logOut` or `sync*`, called or torn off | RevenueCat gets the household id and the purchase: no attributes, no device ids, never an anonymous customer (C3) |
| `no-wall-time-wait-in-tests` | `Future.delayed` in `app/test` | It races the timers it waits for: after a stall the test resumes mid-reload (DECISIONS 18.17). Use `elapse()` or `fakeAsync` |
| schema check: history | Editing or deleting a migration on `main`; a new one sorting before main's newest | Production already ran it; deploys refuse older migrations |
| schema check: RLS | A public table without RLS; a `household_id` table without an `is_household_member(household_id)` policy or a two-household pgTAP case | PostgREST serves every public table |
| squawk compat rules | Dropping or renaming a column or table, NOT NULL without default, type changes, dropping a function or view | TestFlight and Play builds lag `main`; old apps must keep working |
| `ignore-needs-reason`, schema check: ignores | An `ast-grep-ignore` or `squawk-ignore` without ` -- <reason>` | An exception a reviewer cannot judge gets copied |
