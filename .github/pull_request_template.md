## What

<!-- What changed, for whom. -->

## Why

## How verified

- [ ] User-facing behaviour changed? The feature file in `.cursor/skills/verify-hummlist/features/` and its section in `FEATURES-FOR-WRITERS.md` (last verified: commit and date) are updated in this PR (`docs/FEATURE_MAP.md`).

<!-- Commands and results, the green CI run, screenshots where the UI changed. -->

## Changelog

<!--
What users of the app notice, for the stores' "What's new" and hummlist.com/changelog
(docs/CHANGELOG.md). scripts/push-pr.sh lands this section in the commit main takes; CI checks
its structure.

One paragraph per item: a category line (new, improved or fixed), then one sentence in German
(de:) and one in English (en:). Write in user words what the user can now do or what now works.
No job or PR numbers, file, table or tool names.

Leave out what users don't see: typo and copy fixes, refactors, CI, docs, tests, lints, deploys,
server internals. Add a fix only if a user could have noticed the bug. If nothing here is
visible to users, write only: none

Not everyone has it yet? Add "flag: <key>" when the item ships behind a feature flag, or
"hold: <key>" when it waits for something else (the Alexa skill: hold: alexa-certification).
The key must be in releases/flags.json; the item stays out of the public changelog until that
file opens its gate.

Example:

new
de: Mit Alexa fügst du Artikel per Sprache hinzu: „Alexa, sag Hummlist, füg Milch hinzu“.
en: Add items with Alexa: "Alexa, tell Hummlist to add milk".
hold: alexa-certification

fixed
de: Die Liste springt beim Abhaken nicht mehr nach oben.
en: The list no longer jumps to the top when you check off an item.
