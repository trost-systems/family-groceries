# Hummlist privacy data map

What Hummlist stores or sends about people, where, why, on which legal basis, for how long and how
it goes away, with the code that does it. It is the single source for the store forms (job 14:
App Store "App Privacy", Play "Data safety") and the fact base behind the privacy policy
(`site/content/legal/datenschutz.md` and `privacy.md`, job 33a). Not legal advice: Peter approves
the policy text. Written in job 24 (2026-10-30) against `main` 0b47f91 (after jobs 33a-g, 31 and 32b). A job that adds, sends or
keeps new personal data updates its row here in the same PR.

Legal bases: (b) Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR, the contract (running the app you signed up for);
(a) Art. 6(1)(a), consent; (c) Art. 6(1)(c), legal obligation; (f) Art. 6(1)(f), legitimate
interest.

Apple and Google take the payment as independent controllers (Apple as commissionaire, Google as
merchant of record); Hummlist gets no payment data and no store account name or email. Docs:

Only after a member taps "Weiter zum Kauf" or "Kauf wiederherstellen" in a household without Lifetime (job 47, H-67); opening the page or the app contacts no one. From the tap on, the SDK stays configured for that app run and refreshes its caches from RevenueCat when the app returns to the foreground. No user id, e-mail, name or list data; no attributes or device/ad ids (lint rules). To Apple, the SDK passes the household id with the purchase (StoreKit 2 `appAccountToken`; StoreKit 1 on iOS 15 `applicationUsername`); to Google, the Base64 SHA-256 of it (`obfuscatedAccountId`, unsalted; no `obfuscatedProfileId`).

## Account deletion and export (job 9)

- Mehr → Konto → Konto löschen: the account function deletes the auth user, profile,
  memberships, tokens and OAuth grants; the last member takes the household with them; otherwise
  items and history stay with `added_by`/`bought_by`/`actor` nulled. Without the app:
  `app/web/konto-loeschen.html` or support@hummlist.com.
- Mehr → Konto → Meine Daten exportieren (`export_my_data`, latest definition in

## Not collected

No advertising, no sale of data, no location (PostHog GeoIP off), no contacts, no tracking or
analytics without consent, no cookies or trackers on hummlist.com (`site/test/preview.test.mjs`).
The web app's posthog-js sets no cookie and no localStorage key (job 44, memory persistence).

## Differences to the privacy policy (`site/content/legal/datenschutz.md`)

Two open. The in-app purchase (job 25) is in the draft section 5a, not yet in the policy; Hummlist
sells nothing until it is (NEEDS_PETER Job 25). And job 44 (PostHog SDK) adds device and app
properties, flag requests, native crash reports and SDK files on the device that the policy and
the consent text do not name yet; the sentences for the Legal Review are in NEEDS_LEAD "Job 44"
