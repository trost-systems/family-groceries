# Releases

Every green merge to `main` reaches the internal testers with no human step
(Peter, 2026-10-29: "internal testing / test flight should be pushed on every
merge to main"). The Release workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) starts
when CI (`ci.yml`) finishes green on a push to `main` and ships the newest
green `main` commit:

- iOS to TestFlight, internal group "Familie" only. No external groups, no
  Beta App Review, no App Store submission.
- Android to the Play internal testing track.

The web app is not part of these runs: `https://app.hummlist.com` is public,
so it moves only with a dispatched run (below, [Public releases](#public-releases)).
`main` itself is on `https://preview.app.hummlist.com`
([`DEPLOY.md`](DEPLOY.md), section "Web app").

Both platforms get the same build number in a run. The one-time store setup
that needs a browser is in [`NEEDS_LEAD.md`](NEEDS_LEAD.md); decisions are in
[`DECISIONS.md`](DECISIONS.md), sections "Job 23" and "Job 30".

## Public releases

There is no public release path yet: no Play production track, no App Store
review, no external TestFlight group, and the Paid Applications agreement
stays unaccepted. Nothing in this workflow promotes a build beyond the
internal testers. A public release will be a separate, later step with a
manual gate: a build that the internal testers have had, after a full
end-to-end pass on it, weekly or more often once that is quick and reliable.
It needs its own job and Peter's go.

What is public is recorded in [`releases/releases.json`](../releases/README.md),
empty until the first public release. The public release step, once it exists,
must end like this: after both stores have accepted the build, it calls the
**Public release record** workflow
(`.github/workflows/public-release-record.yml`, `workflow_call` or a
dispatch) with `version`, `sha` (the released `main` commit), `build` and
`dry_run: false`. The workflow computes the release's day and git stats
(`scripts/release/record.mjs`), commits the entry to `main` as
`Release <version>: public release record` and pushes it. That push
redeploys hummlist.com, whose guides then show what the new version has
([`DEPLOY.md`](DEPLOY.md), "Guides site"). It starts no store upload: a push
with the workflow's token starts no other workflow, and `plan.sh` counts only
`app/` and `release.yml` as app changes. A dispatch defaults to
`dry_run: true`, which prints the entry and changes nothing.

### Changelog and store texts (job 39)

Each public release has a user-facing changelog, collected from the
`## Changelog` notes in the PRs ([`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md)). The order:

1. **Cut.** Choose the version and the `main` commit, then run
   `node scripts/release/changelog.mjs draft --version X --sha S`. It writes
   `releases/changelog/X.json` with the items since the previous public
   release and the "What's new" texts: App Store up to 4000 (counted as UTF-8
   bytes), Google Play up to 500 Unicode characters, in German and English.
   Commit the draft in a PR.
   The dry run (`--dry-run`) also lists the items held back by a flag or a
   hold, and the items of `releases/changelog/pending.json` whose gate is
   open now (job 40, [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md), "Gated items").
2. **Review.** Peter reviews and edits the wording in that PR. He fills in the
   headline (`title`) and approves the release; a public release needs his yes
   anyway. He also checks:
   - **Held items** (the draft's `held`): is each one still not out for
     everyone? If a flag reached 100 % or a hold is over (Alexa certified),
     the same PR sets it in `releases/flags.json` and redrafts with `--force`.
   - **The override**, if the version has one
     (`releases/changelog/X.override.md`, the 1.0 launch text): he approves
     it by deleting its `status: draft` line. Until then `record.mjs add`
     refuses to record the version.
   After any edit, run
   `node scripts/release/changelog.mjs store --version X`. Preview builds of
   hummlist.com show the draft on the changelog page with the banner
   "Entwurf, noch nicht im Store". Production does not show it.
3. **Submit.** The store submission uses the draft's `store.app_store` and
   `store.play` texts as "What's new". That step does not exist yet: no
   metadata upload, no review submission.
4. **Publish.** After both stores accept the build, the public release step
   runs the Public release record workflow (above). `record.mjs` puts the
   draft into the new entry as `changelog` and deletes the draft file (and
   the override) in the same commit. In that commit it also writes the
   still-held items to `releases/changelog/pending.json`. That push to `main` redeploys hummlist.com, so the changelog
   page shows the version only once it is live in the stores.

Without a draft, the release is recorded without a changelog: the workflow
warns, and the page shows "Fehlerbehebungen und Verbesserungen.". TestFlight's
"What to Test" (`scripts/release/notes.sh`) stays as it is: PR titles since
the last upload, for the internal testers.

## When a run ships

Three events start a run:

| Event | When | Ships |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `workflow_run` | CI finished on `main` | The newest green `main` commit. Only a green CI run on a push to this repository starts the plan; after a red one (or a fork's PR from a branch named `main`, or a dispatched CI run) every job is skipped and nothing ships. |
| `schedule` | Mondays 03:00 UTC | The same as `workflow_run`. A catch-up: it ships nothing when the testers have the newest green `main`, but re-ships before TestFlight's 90-day expiry or after Apple expired the builds, and picks up a commit whose `workflow_run` event never came. |
| `workflow_dispatch` | By hand | The `main` commit it was started on, which must be green ([Run it by hand](#run-it-by-hand)). The only event that moves `app.hummlist.com`. |

The `plan` job gathers facts (`scripts/release/plan.sh gather`) and decides
(`plan.sh decide`, a pure function with fixture tests in
`scripts/release/test.sh`).

Which commit: `gather` walks `main` from its tip (fetched when the plan runs,
so possibly newer than the commit whose CI started the run) back to the last
upload, reading the newest `ci.yml` push run of each commit (a green rerun
counts). An automatic run takes the first green commit: newer commits whose
CI still runs ship with their own run, red ones never ship. A dispatch takes
the tip only.

Whether it ships: the first rule that matches wins.

| Facts | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Dispatch: the newest `ci.yml` push run on the commit has not finished, or did not conclude `success` | Skip with a notice. `force` does not override this: only green `main` ships. |
| Automatic: no green commit since the last upload, and no upload ever | Skip. |
| The build number is not above TestFlight's highest build | Fail, naming `BUILD_NUMBER_OFFSET`. |
| `upload` is off | Build, sign and validate (dry run). |
| `force` is on | Ship. |
| No earlier upload run | Ship. |
| A newer green commit than the last upload, and something under `app/` or `release.yml` changed since it | Ship. |
| TestFlight has no installable build (all expired) | Ship (again). |
| The last upload run is 60 or more days old | Ship (again), before TestFlight's 90-day expiry. |
| A newer green commit, but only docs, CI, scripts or the backend changed | Skip: the testers already have this app. |
| Otherwise | Skip with the notice "main is unchanged since the last upload". |

The last two skips set the plan output `current`, which closes the failure
issue. When the commit that started the run is older than the last upload
(its CI finished after a newer commit's), the notice says so.

The last upload run is the newest successful Release run on `main` whose
`Uploaded <sha>` job succeeded; the job's name carries the commit it shipped,
since a `workflow_run` run's own commit is `main`'s tip when it started.
(Runs before job 30 named it `Uploaded` and shipped their own commit.) That
job runs only after a real upload, so dry runs and skipped runs never count.
The workflow needs no tags and no `contents: write` for this; `actions: read`
on the plan job is enough.

### Merge bursts

The workflow's concurrency group `release` runs one Release run at a time
and never cancels one in progress, so an upload always finishes. GitHub keeps
at most one run pending and cancels the older pending run when a newer one
arrives. Every run picks the newest green commit when its plan starts, so
whichever run survives ships everything merged so far: three quick merges
give one or two uploads, never an older commit after a newer one. CI on
`main` runs per commit (`ci.yml` groups push runs by SHA), so an older
commit's CI can finish after a newer one's; its run then finds the newer
commit already shipped and skips.

## Run it by hand

A `workflow_run` or scheduled run has no inputs; the plan job gives it the
dispatch defaults, so all three events take the same path from there. The log
line `Release plan (workflow_run): platform=both upload=true force=false
main=<sha> trigger=<sha>` (or `(schedule)`, `(workflow_dispatch)`) shows it.

```bash
gh workflow run release.yml                       # main's tip, if green and not shipped yet; moves app.hummlist.com
gh workflow run release.yml -f force=true         # ship even if the testers already have it
gh workflow run release.yml -f upload=false       # build, sign and validate only
gh workflow run release.yml -f platform=android   # one platform
```

| Input | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `platform` | `both` | `both`, `ios` or `android`. |
| `upload` | `true` | Off: iOS builds, signs and runs `altool --validate-app`; Android builds, signs, checks the signer and, once Play is set up, runs the upload with `validate_only`. Nothing is published. |
| `force` | `false` | Ship even if the testers already have this app (main unchanged, or only non-app files changed). |
| `simulate_failure` | `false` | Fail the plan job on purpose, to test the failure issue. |

A dispatch that finds `main` unchanged skips, so it does not move
`app.hummlist.com` either; to publish the web app of a commit the testers
already have, use `force=true` (a new store build of the same commit) or the
manual push in [`DEPLOY.md`](DEPLOY.md), section "Web app".

The `release` environment allows deployments from `main` only, so a run on
another branch fails at its first job. `workflow_run` and scheduled runs
always run on `main`.

## Failures

An automatic run (`workflow_run` or `schedule`) that fails opens the issue
"Internal release failed" with the run link, the commit, the failing job
(`plan`, `ios`, `android`) and what reached TestFlight and Play internal
("may not" where a stopped job cannot tell). While it is open, every further
failed run comments on it instead of opening another, so a broken pipeline
during a day of merges is one issue with one comment per run. The next run
that uploads, or that finds the testers on the newest green `main`
(`current`), closes it. Dry runs never touch it. A failed dispatch does not
open the issue, since whoever started it watches the run; `simulate_failure`
does (and its body also says whether `app.hummlist.com` moved). Until job 30
the issue was "Weekly release failed" (#53, closed). Watch the repository's
issues (Watch, Custom, Issues) to get these.

A red CI on `main` starts no release and opens no issue here: CI itself is
the signal, and the next green commit ships.

What to do, by failing job:

- `plan`, "CI concluded failure" (dispatch only): fix `main`; the merge that
  fixes it ships by itself once its CI is green.
- `plan`, "Profile ... is INVALID": see [Capabilities](#capabilities).
- `plan`, "Build number ... is not above": a build was uploaded outside this
  workflow. Raise `BUILD_NUMBER_OFFSET` in `release.yml` so that
  `offset + run number` is above it.
- `ios`, upload: an Apple outage gets one retry, after the lane has looked
  for the build in App Store Connect for 10 minutes (a first attempt may have
  arrived after all). Check
  <https://developer.apple.com/system-status/> and rerun the failed jobs, but
  only of the newest Release run: a rerun keeps its run number and its
  commit, so rerunning an older run after a newer one shipped would upload an
  older build. For an older run, let the next merge (or a dispatch) ship.
- `ios`, "Wait for TestFlight processing": `INVALID` or `FAILED` means Apple
  rejected the binary; Apple's email to the account holder says why. A build
  still processing after 45 minutes usually turns `VALID` later; check
  TestFlight before rerunning.
- `ios`, "VALID but already expired": see
  [TestFlight builds expired](#testflight-builds-expired).
- `android`, "is signed by ..., not by the upload key": `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_BASE64`
  holds another key; restore it from `~/groceries-ops/secrets/android/`.
- `android`, upload: Play's error names the cause. "Only releases with status
  draft may be created on draft app" means `PLAY_RELEASE_STATUS` must be
  `draft` until the app leaves draft (`NEEDS_LEAD.md`, L3).
- `web` (`Web production`, dispatch only), push rejected: `release` holds a commit that is
  not an ancestor of this one (someone force-pushed it), or a branch rule
  blocks the push (there must be none on `release`). The issue says which
  stores got the build; check what `release` holds, then `git push --force
  origin <sha>:refs/heads/release` once you are sure, or let the next release
  move it.

### TestFlight builds expired

On 2026-10-26 at 13:14:02 to 13:14:03 UTC, Apple expired every unexpired
TestFlight build of the team at once: Hummlist 1002 (uploaded the day
before), build 1001 of the old app record (`6826907810`) and all 65 builds of
another app of the team that were younger than 90 days (uploaded since
2026-09-13). No build of ours was expired by hand, no Beta App Review
submission exists, no newer build replaced them, and the certificate, profile
and membership-bound API access kept working. Other teams report the same
mass expiry on Apple's developer forums (thread 813703: January, July and
August 2026); Apple's TestFlight team acknowledged an investigation and has
not named a cause.
`DECISIONS.md`, Job 23, has the query results.

The next run handles it: when TestFlight has no installable build, the
newest green commit ships again even if the testers had it (rule above), so
testers have a build again after the next merge, or the next Monday's
catch-up at the latest. To get one sooner, dispatch the workflow with the
defaults. If a new build comes out expired too, the run fails ("VALID but
already expired"): then the account holder opens a case with Apple Developer
Support (developer.apple.com/contact, TestFlight) quoting the build number;
nothing in the account or the repo fixes it.

## App identity

The app is "Hummlist", bundle ID and Android `applicationId`
`com.hummlist.app` since job 20. `app/fastlane/Appfile`, `Matchfile` and
`APP_ID` in the `Fastfile` name it.

Since job 63 the iOS app embeds a second bundle, the Home Screen widget
extension `com.hummlist.app.HomeWidget` (Xcode target `HomeWidget`,
[HOME_WIDGETS.md](HOME_WIDGETS.md)). It is signed with its own App Store
profile; `Matchfile` and `WIDGET_ID` in the `Fastfile` name it. The app and
the extension share the App Group `group.com.hummlist.app`. The extension
takes the app's version and build number (`FLUTTER_BUILD_NAME`,
`FLUTTER_BUILD_NUMBER`), as App Store Connect requires.

- iOS: App Store Connect app "Hummlist", Apple ID `6826922741`, primary
  language de-DE. Internal group "Familie" has access to all builds, so every
  `VALID` build reaches it. The old app record (`6826907810`,
  `com.petertrost.familygroceries`) gets no further builds.
- Android: Play app "Hummlist" (app ID `4972374295718364245`), created by
  the Lead on 2026-10-27. The Lead uploaded the first bundle (0.1.0, version
  code 1003, built on the box) by hand to internal testing, list "Familie",
  on 2026-10-28 and set `PLAY_RELEASE_STATUS` to `completed`; since then
  every upload run rolls out to internal testers.

## Lanes

Run lanes from `app/` with `bundle exec fastlane <platform> <lane>`.

| Lane | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `ios certificates` | Creates or renews the distribution certificate and profiles in the match repo. Run by the manual Certificates workflow only; the team keeps its three distribution certificates, so don't run it. |
| `ios preflight` | Fails if either App Store profile (the app's, the widget's) is not `ACTIVE`, naming the ones that are not; writes TestFlight's highest build number and whether any build is installable to `TESTFLIGHT_JSON`. The plan job runs it. |
| `ios beta` | Installs the certificate and both profiles from match (read-only), signs `Runner` and `HomeWidget` manually, each with its own profile, runs `flutter build ipa`. `RELEASE_UPLOAD=true` uploads to TestFlight (internal only, one retry), otherwise `altool --validate-app` validates the IPA. |
| `ios wait_processing` | Sets What to Test (de-DE and en-US) as soon as the build shows up (a refusal only warns), then polls until it is `VALID` (at most `WAIT_MINUTES`, 45). Fails on `INVALID`, `FAILED`, an expired build or two API errors in a row. |
| `ios renew_profile` | Regenerates both App Store profiles (every identifier in the `Matchfile`) with the existing certificate `GN85KDC962` and pushes them to the match repo ([Capabilities](#capabilities)). |
| `android build` | `flutter build appbundle`, signed with `android/key.properties`. |
| `android play_access` | Gets a Google token for the service account (fails if that does not work), then tries to open a Play edit; writes `ok` or Play's refusal to `PLAY_ACCESS_FILE`. |
| `android internal` | Uploads the AAB to the `internal` track with `PLAY_RELEASE_STATUS`, or validates it only (`RELEASE_UPLOAD` not `true`). Uploads no listing, changelog or images. |

The lint gate runs `scripts/release/test.sh` and shellchecks
`scripts/release/`; CI's `fastlane` job checks that the Gemfile.lock installs
and the Fastfile parses.

## What to Test

`scripts/release/notes.sh` writes the TestFlight notes: the titles of the PRs
merged into `main` since the last upload's commit (`main` takes one
`<PR title> (#n)` commit per PR), newest first, at most 12 lines. It drops
PRs about the repo's own machinery (docs, CI, lints, gates, deploys, backups,
release tooling, the verify skill; the word list is `internal` in the
script), the `Job <n>:` prefixes, PR numbers and anything that looks like an
email address. The lane removes what Apple rejects (emoji, `<`) and cuts to
4000 bytes; if App Store Connect still refuses the notes, the run warns and
stays green, since the build reached the testers anyway. de-DE gets a German heading,
en-US an English one; the titles stay as written. Play gets no release notes
(`skip_upload_changelogs`; job 14 owns store metadata).

The first upload (Release run 11, build 1021) had no earlier upload to start
from, so the script took the last 20 `main` commits, and after the filters
only "rename the app to Hummlist (com.hummlist.app)" was left. That note was
a one-off: from build 1021 on, every run lists the PRs since the previous
upload.

## Secrets and variables

All live in the `release` environment (Settings, Environments, `release`;
deployments from `main` only). Values marked "variable" may also be secrets.

| Name | Kind | Used by | Value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `APPLE_TEAM_ID` | variable | iOS | `VCZSHMZY25`. |
| `MATCH_GIT_URL` | variable | iOS | SSH URL of the private certificates repo. |
| `MATCH_DEPLOY_KEY` | secret | iOS | Private SSH key; its public half is a deploy key on the certificates repo. |
| `MATCH_PASSWORD` | secret | iOS | Passphrase that encrypts the certificates repo. |
| `APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_KEY_ID` | secret | iOS | Key ID of the App Store Connect API key (`family-groceries-ci`). |
| `APP_STORE_CONNECT_ISSUER_ID` | secret | iOS | Issuer ID shown above the API keys list. |
| `APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_KEY_P8` | secret | iOS | Full text of the `AuthKey_<id>.p8` file. |
| `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_BASE64` | secret | Android | The upload keystore, base64-encoded. |
| `ANDROID_KEY_PROPERTIES` | secret | Android | The `key.properties` file (format below). |
| `PLAY_RELEASE_STATUS` | variable | Android | Unset: Play is not set up, no upload. `draft`: upload as a draft release (until the app leaves draft). `completed`: upload and roll out to internal testers. |
| `REVENUECAT_PURCHASES` | variable | both | Unset: no purchase screen ("bald verfügbar"). `true` at the paywall go-live ([`PAYWALL_RELEASE.md`](PAYWALL_RELEASE.md)). |
| `REVENUECAT_APPLE_API_KEY` | secret | iOS | RevenueCat's public App Store SDK key (`appl_…`). Without it the build sells nothing. |
| `REVENUECAT_GOOGLE_API_KEY` | secret | Android | RevenueCat's public Play SDK key (`goog_…`). Without it the build sells nothing. |
| `INTEGRATION_LOCK` | variable | both | Unset: no Premium card in the integration settings. `true` once the server's `integration_lock` switch is on ([`PAYWALL_RELEASE.md`](PAYWALL_RELEASE.md)). |

Play needs no key: the Android job signs in to Google with Workload Identity
Federation (below). The workflow's `env` holds the non-secret identifiers:
`BUILD_NUMBER_OFFSET`, `UPLOAD_CERT_SHA256`, the workload identity provider
and the service account email.

The build needs no Supabase defines: `app/lib/app/environment.dart` defaults
to the production URL and publishable key. Both platforms pass
`--dart-define-from-file=config/auth.json`, the public Google and Apple
sign-in client IDs and `APP_URL`.

## Build numbers and versions

The build number is `BUILD_NUMBER_OFFSET + GITHUB_RUN_NUMBER` (offset 1010).
Every run, dry runs and skips included, takes a new run number, so the
number only grows on both stores, and iOS and Android get the same one in a
run. The run number counts all runs of the workflow, whatever started them
(`workflow_run`, `schedule`, `workflow_dispatch`), and a newer run never
ships an older commit, so build numbers and commits rise together. A run
cancelled while pending still uses up its number; gaps are fine. A rerun
keeps its number (see Failures, `ios`). When the schedule started, TestFlight's highest was 1002
(Release run 2, offset 1000 then) and Play's first bundle, built on the box
for the Lead's first manual upload, had version code 1003. The offset went
to 1010 so that the next run (3) builds 1013, above both. The plan job fails
a run whose number is not above TestFlight's highest; Play rejects a version
code it already has, and the offset is the fix for both.

The version name comes from `version` in `app/pubspec.yaml` (`0.1.0+1`; the
`+1` is ignored because the lanes pass `--build-number`). To bump it, change
`version` in a PR, for example to `0.2.0+1`. The next run uploads 0.2.0 with
the next build number. TestFlight groups builds by version; Play shows the
version name. A version bump never resets the build number.

## Android signing

`app/android/app/build.gradle.kts` signs release builds with the key named in
`app/android/key.properties`:

```properties
storePassword=<store password>
keyPassword=<key password>
keyAlias=upload
storeFile=../upload-keystore.jks
```

`storeFile` resolves from `app/android/app`, so `../upload-keystore.jks` is
`app/android/upload-keystore.jks`; that is where the workflow writes the
keystore, and it deletes both files after the build. Without
`key.properties`, release builds sign with the debug key, so local builds
work without secrets; the workflow's `check-aab.sh` step fails a bundle
signed by anything but the upload key. `key.properties` and keystores are in
`.gitignore`.

The upload key (created 2026-10-27, job 23): PKCS12, RSA 4096, alias
`upload`, `CN=Hummlist, O=Trost Systems`, valid until 2054-03-14. The
keystore and its `key.properties` are on the build box in
`~/groceries-ops/secrets/android/` (mode 600) and in the `release` secrets
above. Copy both to a password manager; Google can reset a lost upload key,
but only through Play Console support.

| Certificate | SHA-1 | SHA-256 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Upload key | `D4:9D:98:9E:AD:E3:2E:FE:D2:D3:A1:7A:71:B2:95:29:84:81:78:69` | `2C:9B:48:6D:AF:1B:94:AB:3F:92:38:49:CC:0F:C3:42:EF:09:64:2C:32:40:74:97:69:25:61:74:0C:BA:84:F5` |
| Play app signing key (Google-generated, Play Console, Setup, App signing; L3, 2026-10-28) | `77:B6:9B:5E:8F:10:5D:3F:46:3C:62:C3:BC:BE:A8:3D:EA:10:08:53` | `27:0E:40:2B:04:1D:4D:C8:E7:65:10:C6:B4:36:FE:E8:51:D9:08:E6:00:43:89:7F:4E:AF:B9:2F:BC:7B:E4:2A` |

Play App Signing holds the app signing key, which signs what testers
install. Google sign-in on Play builds and `assetlinks.json` (job 22) need
the app signing key's fingerprints; debug and locally signed builds need the
upload key's.

### Play service account

`play-release@family-groceries-ci.iam.gserviceaccount.com` (Google Cloud
project `family-groceries-ci`, Android Publisher API enabled) has no key and
no project roles. Only jobs in this repo's `release` environment can act as
it: its `roles/iam.workloadIdentityUser` binding names the subject
`repo:trost-systems@267752722/family-groceries@1429864759:environment:release`
on the workload identity pool `github`, provider `family-groceries`.
`google-github-actions/auth` exchanges the job's GitHub OIDC token and writes
an `external_account` credentials file, which fastlane's supply reads as
`json_key`. Play Console grants the account access to Hummlist
(`NEEDS_LEAD.md`, L4).

## iOS signing

[match](https://docs.fastlane.tools/actions/match/) keeps the distribution
certificate (`GN85KDC962`, Apple Distribution, expires 2027-10-25) and the
App Store profiles "match AppStore com.hummlist.app" and "match AppStore
com.hummlist.app.HomeWidget", encrypted with
`MATCH_PASSWORD`, in the private repo
`trost-systems/family-groceries-certificates`. The workflow loads
`MATCH_DEPLOY_KEY` into an SSH agent so match can clone it.
`app/fastlane/Matchfile` is read-only by default, so a release run never
creates certificates. The Xcode project keeps automatic signing for local
development; `ios beta` switches to manual signing for the release build only.

`Info.plist` sets `ITSAppUsesNonExemptEncryption` to `false`, so TestFlight
does not ask the export compliance question for each build.

### Capabilities

Enabling a capability on the App ID `com.hummlist.app` or
`com.hummlist.app.HomeWidget` (for example Associated Domains for job 22)
makes that App ID's App Store profile `INVALID`. The next Release run then
fails in `plan` ("Profile ... is INVALID") before any build; a profile that
does not exist yet fails the same way ("is missing"). The sequence:

1. The Lead enables the capability in the browser (`NEEDS_LEAD.md`, L6).
   For the Home Screen widget (job 63) that is, under Certificates,
   Identifiers & Profiles: register the App Group `group.com.hummlist.app`;
   register the App ID `com.hummlist.app.HomeWidget`; enable App Groups on
   both `com.hummlist.app` and `com.hummlist.app.HomeWidget` and assign the
   group to each.
2. From the build box, in `app/` (the box reaches GitHub over HTTPS only, so
   the match URL is the HTTPS one; `gh` is the git credential helper):

   ```bash
   set -a; . ~/groceries-ops/env; set +a   # MATCH_PASSWORD
   APPLE_TEAM_ID=VCZSHMZY25 \
   MATCH_GIT_URL=https://github.com/trost-systems/family-groceries-certificates.git \
   APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_KEY_ID=4J3N457M89 \
   APP_STORE_CONNECT_ISSUER_ID=<issuer ID> \
   APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_KEY_P8="$(cat ~/groceries-ops/AuthKey_4J3N457M89.p8)" \
   bundle exec fastlane ios renew_profile
   ```

   match regenerates the profiles of every identifier in the `Matchfile`
   (and creates a missing one, such as the widget's the first time) with the
   certificate `GN85KDC962` and pushes them to the match repo. It creates a certificate only when the repo holds
   none, so it creates and revokes none here. `MATCH_FORCE=false` checks
   without regenerating (proven 2026-10-27: "All required keys, certificates
   and provisioning profiles are installed", repo unchanged).
3. The PR that adds the entitlement (for example
   `com.apple.developer.associated-domains` in
   `ios/Runner/Runner.entitlements`, or job 63's
   `com.apple.security.application-groups` there and in
   `ios/HomeWidget/HomeWidget.entitlements`) lands after step 2.
4. Dispatch the Release workflow; the plan's preflight passes and the build
   signs with the new profile.

Order matters only between 1 and 2: a run between them fails in `plan` with
the message above and costs nothing else. A run after step 2 but
before step 3 builds fine; the new profile allows the capability without
requiring it.

## Build locally

Android, from `app/`:

```bash
flutter build apk --release --dart-define-from-file=config/auth.json        # build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk
flutter build appbundle --release --dart-define-from-file=config/auth.json  # build/app/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab
```

Add `--build-number=<n>` to match a store build. To check which key signed a
build, run `keytool -printcert -jarfile <aab>` or
`apksigner verify --print-certs <apk>`.

iOS builds need macOS and Xcode. On a Mac with the match secrets in the
environment, `BUILD_NUMBER=<n> RELEASE_UPLOAD=true bundle exec fastlane ios beta` builds and
uploads; `flutter build ipa` alone builds with automatic signing.

Ruby for the lanes: `app/.ruby-version` names the version CI uses. Run
`bundle install` in `app/` once.

## App icon

`scripts/icons.py` (Python 3 with Pillow) draws the icon and writes every
size: `app/assets/icon/icon.png` (1024 px source), the iOS `AppIcon` set, the
Android launcher and adaptive icon mipmaps, and the web icons and favicon.
Change the drawing there and rerun `python3 scripts/icons.py`.
