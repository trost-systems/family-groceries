# Hill-climb hc-design-v2-web (job 154)

Design quality of the public site hummlist.com, scored by a council of three fresh Claude Opus judges against a rubric researched and frozen before the baseline (10 aspects: typography, hierarchy, colour and contrast, spacing, layout, design-system consistency, accessibility, motion, iconography, empty and error states; motion is not scorable from stills and is left out). Each judge answers every criterion yes/no/n.a., then scores each aspect 1-10 against anchors. Aspect score = median of the 3 judges; overall = minimum of the aspect medians (the mean is reported too).

The judges, the rubric, the prompts and the screenshot harness live in the job's ops directory, outside this repo; nothing in the repo calls a model. Judges are separate processes with an empty working directory and only the screenshots; they never see scores, steps, diffs or which version is new. The harness refuses to score (score 0) when any frozen input's hash differs.

## Keep rule

A step is kept only if (1) a blind pairwise council prefers it: baseline and candidate shown as "Version P" / "Version Q" in a random order per judge, each judge picks P, Q or tie per aspect, aspect verdict = majority, step verdict = majority of the decided aspects; (2) the absolute minimum does not drop by more than the noise band below the best kept state; (3) every guardrail passes.

## Screenshot set (fixed before the baseline)

40 shots of a local production build of site/ served on 127.0.0.1: /de (1440 light, every tile; 1440 dark, 2 tiles; 390 light, every tile; 390 dark, 2; 390 light at text 150 %, 2; keyboard focus after 3 Tabs), /en, /de/anleitungen, /de/anleitungen/siri-kurzbefehl (also at text 150 %), /de/changelog, /datenschutz (also at text 150 %), /support and the 404 page, at 1440 and 390 px, light and dark. Text 150 % is the browser's default font size raised from 16 to 24 px. Two renders of the same tree are byte-identical.

## Baseline

Main at `5e639d3a`. Three absolute runs: minimum [4, 4, 4], mean [6.556, 6.444, 6.556]. Score (median) **4**, noise band 0.5 (max - min, floor 0.5).

A-vs-A check (identical images as P and Q, 3 runs): 27 of 27 aspect verdicts tie, 81 of 81 single judge votes tie; seeds [[4042588824, 1315228522, 1139922973], [2523588036, 157228610, 757001154], [3829715989, 4274223690, 1574030434]].

## Steps

| # | hypothesis | pairwise (cand / base / tie aspects) | min (mean) | verdict | note |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| w1 | dark-mode cards use the hard 3D offset instead of a blurred glow (C5 one depth style) | cand 1 / base 0 / tie 8 | 4 (mean 6.778) | keep | guard-web green: 167/167 site tests, copy identical 27+31 pages, crawl + contrast pass |
| w2 | empty changelog and 404 get a hex empty-state mark and a centred focal composition (CSS only) | cand 4 / base 0 / tie 5 | 6 (mean 7.111) | keep | guard-web green: 167/167 site tests, copy identical 27+31 pages, crawl + contrast pass |
| w3 | headings hyphenate long German compounds on narrow screens (hyphens:auto, limit 12 5 5) | cand 3 / base 0 / tie 6 | 6 (mean 7.333) | keep | guard-web green: 167/167 site tests, copy identical 27+31 pages, crawl (2nd run; 1st timed out on /en/privacy networkidle at load 20) + contrast pass |
| w4 | waitlist email field, iPhone/Android radios and 404 language links drawn as hexes like every other control | cand 2 / base 0 / tie 7 | 7 (mean 7.556) | keep | guard-web green: 167/167 site tests, copy identical 27+31 pages, crawl + contrast pass (focus rings, dark hex contours); note: the delegate halved one padding line (.wl-option side padding) after this measurement, before the commit; that line was first measured as part of w5 |
| w5 | waitlist fine print and field helper at 1.5 line height with a clear gap under the button | cand 1 / base 0 / tie 8 | 7 (mean 7.333) | keep | guard-web green: 167/167 site tests, copy identical 27+31 pages, crawl + contrast pass; the measured tree also carried the w4 .wl-option padding tweak (see w4) |
| w6 | landing slabs share one inner padding so their content starts on one vertical line | cand 3 / base 0 / tie 6 | 7 (mean 7.222) | keep | guard-web green: 167/167 site tests, copy identical 27+31 pages, crawl + contrast pass |
| w7 | guide dialogue box gets even inner padding | cand 1 / base 0 / tie 8 | 7 (mean 7.444) | keep | guard-web green: 167/167 site tests, copy identical 27+31 pages, crawl + contrast pass |
| w8 | 404 hex links drop the link underline and use the hex button label style | cand 4 / base 0 / tie 5 | 7 (mean 7.333) | keep | guard-web green: 167/167 site tests, copy identical 27+31 pages, crawl + contrast pass |
| w9 | header nav reflows evenly at large text (no orphaned English link, even gaps) | cand 4 / base 0 / tie 5 | 7 (mean 7.444) | keep | guard-web green: 167/167 site tests, copy identical 27+31 pages, crawl + contrast pass |
