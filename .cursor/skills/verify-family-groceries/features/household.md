# Household

A list belongs to a household. A new user goes through onboarding (`features/onboarding.md`): Step 1 offers "Haushalt erstellen" and "Einladung annehmen". Under Mehr, "Partner einladen" opens the Einladungen page (make an invite, see the open ones, revoke one), and "Anderem Haushalt beitreten" opens the join screen (titled "Haushalt beitreten" since job 57), which warns before switching.

## Sub-features

- `hh-create` creates a household (onboarding Step 2a) with a name (prefilled "Unser Haushalt", 1-80 characters), with the stores picked from ten common ones or typed (nothing preselected; job 58) or without ("Überspringen"). The 11 categories with "Sonstiges" are always seeded. A double tap or a retry makes one household.
- `hh-invite` makes an invite code (8 characters from A-Z without I and O, and 2-9). It is valid for 7 days and works once: after one person joins with it, it is used up. Step 3 and More's Einladungen show it with its link (`APP_URL/join/<code>`), "gültig bis …", "Link kopieren", "Code kopieren", and "Teilen" (the share sheet in the iOS, Android and macOS apps; Web Share where the browser has it). The Linux fg client shows neither "Teilen" (`invite-share` counts 0) nor the link (no `APP_URL`), only the code.
- `hh-invites-list` lists the household's open invites under Mehr, Partner einladen (`/more/invites`). Any member revokes one ("Widerrufen"); its link and code stop at once. Used, revoked and expired invites are not listed.
- `hh-join` joins with a code (typed at `/join`, or from a link `/join/<code>`): the screen first shows the household's name ("Einladung in den Haushalt"), then "Haushalt beitreten". Lowercase, spaces and dashes in the code are accepted.
- `hh-join-menu` switches a member to another household: the join screen says "Du bist schon in einem Haushalt" and what switching does: as the only member, "Du bist das einzige Mitglied von „<name>“. Trittst du bei, wird „<name>“ mit seiner Liste gelöscht."; with others, "Trittst du bei, verlässt du „<name>“. Die anderen Mitglieder behalten die Liste." Abbrechen is the prominent button.
- `hh-invalid-code` answers made-up, expired, revoked and used codes with the same "Dieser Code ist ungültig oder abgelaufen." The field keeps the code.
- `hh-rate-limit`: after 10 failed codes in an hour, every code (a good one too) gets "Zu viele Versuche. Bitte später noch einmal." until the hour has passed.
- `hh-isolation` keeps one household's items invisible to members of another.
- `hh-members` loads the members' display names with the list, so the title can name who added what is new; a new member's name loads with their first item (recipe in `features/live-sync.md`, `sync-new`).

## How to get to it (user POV)

- Sign up or sign in as a user without a household. After the analytics question (builds with a key), "Willkommen bei Hummlist" offers "Haushalt erstellen" and "Einladung annehmen".
- Tap "Mehr" in the tab bar, then "Partner einladen" or "Anderem Haushalt beitreten" under "Haushalt".
- Open an invite link (`/join/<code>`). The web build opens it, also before sign-in (the code is kept on the device through sign-in). The release phone apps claim `https://app.hummlist.com/join/*` and the other app links of `docs/DEEP_LINKS.md` (`/more/invites` included; universal links, App Links) once app.hummlist.com serves the `.well-known` files. The web side of every link: verify-hummlist `features/app-links.md`. The fg debug build sets no `APP_URL`, so its invites show the code only.

## Driving it with fg

Preconditions:

- Baseline from `features/README.md`. Peter is signed in on the list.
- The lea client hosts a fresh user without a household: run `fg logout --client lea`, then `fg type --key login-email --input hh-$(date +%s)@fg.test --client lea`, `fg type --key login-password --input test-password-123 --client lea`, `fg tap --text Registrieren --client lea` and `fg wait --key welcome --client lea` (Step 1; `household-name` shows only after `onboarding-create`).

- **Invite.** Run `fg tap --key tab-more`, `fg wait --key more-invite`, `fg tap --key more-invite`, `fg wait --key invite-new`, `fg tap --key invite-new` and `fg wait --key invite-copy-code`. Read the code with `fg find --type Text | jq -r '[.elements[].text | select(test("^[A-HJ-NP-Z2-9]{8}$"))][0]'`. `fg tap --key invite-copy-code` shows the snackbar "Code kopiert". `fg back`, then `fg tap --key tab-list`.
- **Join from Step 1.** Run `fg tap --key onboarding-join --client lea`, `fg type --key invite-code --input <code> --client lea` (`abcd-efgh` for `ABCDEFGH` works too), `fg tap --key invite-check --client lea`, `fg wait --text "Familie Test" --client lea` (the preview) and `fg tap --key join-confirm --client lea`. `fg wait --key add-item-field --client lea` succeeds; check membership in the database: `fg db query "select u.email, m.role from household_members m join auth.users u on u.id = m.user_id join households h on h.id = m.household_id where h.name = 'Familie Test'"` lists the new user as `member`. The invite is used up: `fg db query "select used_at is not null as used from invites where code = '<code>'"`.
- **Invalid code.** On the join screen, run `fg type --key invite-code --input ZZZZ2345 --client lea` and `fg tap --key invite-check --client lea`. "Dieser Code ist ungültig oder abgelaufen." shows under the field, which `fg find` and `fg wait` don't see: prove it with `fg screenshot --name hh-invalid-code --client lea`. The same code used a second time gives the same answer.
- **Create.** On Step 1 (another fresh user), run `fg tap --key onboarding-create --client lea`, `fg type --key household-name --input "WG Test" --client lea`, optionally a store chip (`fg tap --key onboarding-store-REWE --client lea`), then `fg tap --key create-household --client lea` (or `skip-stores`, which creates without stores) and `fg wait --key invite-later --client lea` (Step 3). `fg tap --key invite-later --client lea`, then `fg wait --key add-item-field --client lea`. `fg db query "select count(*) from categories c join households h on h.id = c.household_id where h.name = 'WG Test'"` returns 11; the stores query returns the picked stores (none if nothing was picked or after Skip).
- **Revoke.** Under Mehr, Partner einladen, tap `invite-revoke` on a card. `fg wait --contains "Einladung widerrufen"` succeeds. Typed on the join screen of a user outside the household, the code then shows "Dieser Code ist ungültig oder abgelaufen." (screenshot, as in **Invalid code**). A member of the inviting household gets no error: the membership check comes first, and the app goes back to the list.
- **Join from More.** As a member of another household, run `fg tap --key tab-more --client lea`, `fg wait --key more-join --client lea`, `fg tap --key more-join --client lea`, `fg wait --key invite-code --client lea`, `fg type --key invite-code --input <code> --client lea` and `fg tap --key invite-check --client lea`. The screen shows "Du bist schon in einem Haushalt" and what switching does. `fg tap --key join-confirm --client lea`, then `fg wait --key add-item-field --client lea`. The membership query above lists the user in Familie Test.
- **Isolation.** With the fresh user in its own household (after **Create**), add an item there: `fg type --key add-item-field --input Xylophon-WG --submit --client lea` and `fg wait --contains "Hinzugefügt: Xylophon-WG" --client lea`. Then `fg db query "select name from items where name = 'Xylophon-WG'" --as peter` returns no rows, while the same query without `--as` returns one. The pgTAP suite (`supabase/tests/rls.test.sql`) covers writes.
- **Proof.** Screenshot the invite card, the join screen with the household name and the list after joining. Add the `household_members` query output.

## Gotchas

- `hh-join-menu` crashed on main until job 04's fix (2026-10-23): a red error screen after "Beitreten" in the old join dialog (gone since job 22). If it comes back, `fg logs --client lea --grep EXCEPTION` names the cause.
- The release web build (the e2e tests, Vercel) strips Flutter's debug asserts, so a controller disposed too early ("TextEditingController was used after being disposed", `_dependents.isEmpty`) never shows there. Only the debug app (fg) and the widget tests (`app/test/household/onboarding_test.dart`) catch that class of bug.
- After a join (or creating a household) the list must not show the crossed-out cloud ("Offline: …"). Until job 2b it stayed there until the first write: two overlapping resyncs shared one map and one threw. Check with `fg wait --contains Offline --gone --timeout 5 --client lea` after `fg wait --key add-item-field`.
- `--as peter` and `--as lea` mean the seeded users, not whoever is signed in on the client of that name.
- A failed `fg tap` or `fg find` leaves an "EXCEPTION CAUGHT BY FLUTTER FRAMEWORK … ext.flutter.marionette" block in the app log. Skip those when you read `fg logs --grep EXCEPTION` for an app error.
- Users from these recipes stay members of "Familie Test" until `fg up --fresh`. Recipes that count its members (`journeys/account-deletion.sh`) compare with the count before their own join.
- Dialogs animate open. Tap inside one only after `fg wait` for its text or field, or the tap can miss.
- Joining a household leaves the previous one. If the leaver was its last member, that household and its list are deleted. Never run the join from More with the seeded lea or peter unless the recipe restores them (`fg up --fresh`).
- The invite card lists the code as plain text below the label "Code". Pick it by its pattern, not by position.
- Labels on buttons ("Haushalt beitreten", "Haushalt erstellen") are invisible to `fg find`, but `fg tap --text` reaches them; the keys above are steadier.
- Invites work once (job 22). A recipe that joins two users needs two invites.
- Ten failed codes in an hour lock that user out of joining for the hour (`invite_attempts`). Reset in a recipe with `fg db query "delete from invite_attempts" --write`.
- Fresh sign-up users accumulate across runs. Use a timestamp in the email to stay unique.
