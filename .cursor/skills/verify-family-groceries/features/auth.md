# Sign-in

A user signs in with email and password, creates an account with "Registrieren", or asks for a sign-in link by email ("Anmeldelink per E-Mail senden"). Signed-out users only ever see the login screen. Signing out from the More tab returns to it.

## Sub-features

- `auth-password` signs in with email and password and lands on the list (or on the welcome screen without a household).
- `auth-wrong-password` keeps the user on the login screen with an error snackbar.
- `auth-signup` creates an account. Locally, email confirmation is off, so the user lands on the welcome screen.
- `auth-magic-send` sends a sign-in link and shows "Wir haben dir einen Anmeldelink geschickt. Öffne ihn auf diesem Gerät."
- `auth-magic-open` signs the user in when the link is opened on the device.
- `auth-signout` signs out from the More tab ("Mehr", then "Abmelden", key `more-sign-out`) or from the welcome screen's logout icon (tooltip "Abmelden").
- `auth-session` keeps the user signed in across an app restart.
- `auth-form-check` refuses to send an email without "@" ("Bitte eine gültige E-Mail-Adresse eingeben") or a password under 6 characters ("Mindestens 6 Zeichen"), under the fields.
- `auth-legal` shows "Impressum · Datenschutz" ("Imprint · Privacy" in English; keys `legal-imprint`, `legal-privacy`) at the bottom of the login screen, on screen without scrolling. Each opens hummlist.com (`/impressum`, `/datenschutz`; English `/en/imprint`, `/en/privacy`) in the browser, never inside the app.
- `auth-providers` shows "Mit Google anmelden" (key `sign-in-google`) and "Mit Apple anmelden" (key `sign-in-apple`) above the form, with the divider "oder mit E-Mail", in builds that configure them. They redirect to the provider and back to the page the user started from, link an existing account with the same email, and a cancel shows "Anmeldung abgebrochen".

## How to get to it (user POV)

- Open the app signed out. The login screen opens on the Hummlist brand block (app icon #5 and the wordmark, no title bar since job 57) and shows email and password fields (hex fields since job 57; a focused field gets a cobalt contour and a ring) and three buttons (five with the provider buttons, both 48 px with 15 px labels).
- Signed in: tap "Mehr" in the tab bar, scroll down and tap "Abmelden".
- Open the sign-in email on the phone and tap its link.

## Driving it with fg

Preconditions:

- Baseline from `features/README.md`. The lea client is signed out: `fg logout --client lea`.

- **Password sign-in.** Run `fg login lea`. It types into `login-email` and `login-password` and presses Enter. The result is `"screen": "list"` (the list names no household since job 29a; `fg db query "select h.name from household_members m join households h on h.id = m.household_id join auth.users u on u.id = m.user_id where u.email = 'lea@fg.test'"` returns "Familie Test").
- **Legal links.** Signed out, `fg find --key legal-imprint --client lea` and `fg find --key legal-privacy --client lea` each return one element; `fg screenshot --name auth-legal --client lea`. `fg tap --key legal-privacy --client lea` hands https://hummlist.com/datenschutz to the desktop (`pgrep -af hummlist.com/datenschutz`; stop that browser with `kill <pid>`), and the app stays on the login. On the web the e2e spec `e2e/tests/legal.spec.ts` checks the hrefs and the new tab.
- **Wrong password.** Sign out, then run `fg type --key login-email --input lea@fg.test --client lea`, `fg type --key login-password --input falsch123 --submit --client lea` and `fg wait --contains "Anmeldung fehlgeschlagen" --client lea`. `fg find --key login-email --client lea` still returns one element.
- **Form checks.** Signed out, run `fg type --key login-email --input foo --client lea` and `fg type --key login-password --input 123 --submit --client lea`. `fg screenshot --name auth-form-check --client lea` shows both messages under the fields, and the client stays on the login screen.
- **Sign-up.** Run `fg type --key login-email --input neu-$(date +%s)@fg.test --client lea`, `fg type --key login-password --input test-password-123 --client lea` and `fg tap --text Registrieren --client lea`. Then `fg wait --key welcome --client lea` succeeds: onboarding Step 1 of a user without a household (`features/onboarding.md`).
- **Magic link, send.** Sign out, then run `fg type --key login-email --input lea@fg.test --client lea` and `fg tap --text "Anmeldelink per E-Mail senden" --client lea`. `fg wait --contains "Anmeldelink geschickt" --client lea` succeeds. `fg mail --to lea --limit 1` shows the subject "Your sign-in link" and one `/auth/v1/verify?...type=magiclink&redirect_to=com.hummlist.app://login-callback` link.
- **Magic link, open.** Android only: run `adb -s <serial from fg env> shell am start -a android.intent.action.VIEW -d "<link with 127.0.0.1 replaced by 10.0.2.2>"`, then `fg wait --key add-item-field`. On linux, report `auth-magic-open` as not drivable (see Gotchas).
- **Sign-out.** Run `fg logout --client lea`: it taps `tab-more`, scrolls to `more-sign-out` and taps it. The result is `"screen": "login"`. By hand: `fg tap --key tab-more --client lea`, `fg wait --key more-screen --client lea`, `fg marionette --client lea -- scroll-to --key more-sign-out`, `fg tap --key more-sign-out --client lea`, `fg wait --key login-email --client lea`. From the welcome screen (after **Sign-up**), run `fg tap --tooltip Abmelden --client lea` and `fg wait --key login-email --client lea`.
- **Session survives restart.** Sign in with `fg login lea`, then run `fg restart --client lea`, then `fg wait --key add-item-field --client lea`.
- **Provider buttons.** Not drivable with fg: every fg build leaves the provider defines unset, and the Linux app never shows the buttons. Run `scripts/gates/e2e.sh --workers=1 tests/social-sign-in.spec.ts` (it builds the web app with `app/config/e2e.json` and signs in through a fake OpenID provider). A real Google or Apple round trip needs a real account; `features/web-hosting.md` reaches the providers' pages from production.
- **Proof.** Take `fg screenshot --name auth-<sub-feature>` after each step, and record the mail with `fg mail --to lea > $(fg env | jq -r .evidenceDir)/auth-magic-mail.json`.

## Gotchas

- `fg find` and `fg wait` don't see the form's error messages under the fields. Prove them with a screenshot.
- Builds with a PostHog key (Vercel, the stores, the web e2e build) ask about analytics right after the first sign-in on a device, before onboarding or the list (`features/analytics.md`, `an-consent`). fg builds have no key and go straight on.
- Since job 57 the login screen has no "Anmelden" title, so `fg tap --text Anmelden` hits the button; Enter in the password field (`--submit`) or `fg login` work as before.
- `fg login` fails with `not_on_login` when the app is already signed in. Sign out first.
- The magic link redirects to `com.hummlist.app://login-callback` (builds from before the Hummlist rename use `com.petertrost.familygroceries://login-callback`; both are in the allow list). The Linux desktop build registers no handler for that scheme, so opening the link cannot sign it in. Android handles the scheme (intent filter). The web build uses an http redirect instead: `e2e/tests/auth.spec.ts` "magic link signs in on this device" covers it in CI.
- The local stack's links point at `127.0.0.1:<prefix>21`. The emulator reaches that as `10.0.2.2:<prefix>21`.
- Sign-up users from these recipes stay in the database until `fg up --fresh`. They do not affect peter or lea.
- After `fg seed`, a running app keeps a session for a deleted user. The next `fg up` relaunches every app started before the seed, signed out; then `fg login` again.
