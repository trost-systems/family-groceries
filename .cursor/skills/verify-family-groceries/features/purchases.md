# Hummlist Premium (in-app purchase)

Mehr → Hummlist Premium sells Premium for the whole household on iOS and Android through RevenueCat, as a yearly plan (`com.hummlist.app.yearly`, auto-renewing) or Lifetime (`com.hummlist.app.lifetime`, one-time), both the entitlement `premium` (job 49). The page shows each plan with the price the store itself returns (StoreKit or Play Billing, read once when the page opens, never RevenueCat), "inkl. MwSt." only in euros, the yearly plan's disclosures, Restore, the terms and the privacy policy. RevenueCat's SDK starts only on a tap on Buy or Restore (job 47, H-67). The household id is RevenueCat's App User ID; RevenueCat calls the `purchases` function's webhook, which writes Supabase; every member sees the household's Premium live. Premium is active at read time (Lifetime or a tester grant; else a yearly plan whose end lies ahead). With an active yearly plan only Lifetime is offered (with a warning first while the plan renews); a lapsed plan brings both back. Nothing is gated by it yet. The offer needs the build define `REVENUECAT_PURCHASES` and the server switch `premium_offer` (both off by default: "Hummlist Premium ist bald verfügbar."). The web never sells. Since job 57 the page opens on a sticker card titled "Hummlist Premium" with the feature list, the same card as Zugänge's.

## Sub-features

- `iap-offer` shows the yearly card first (`premium-card-yearly`, `premium-price-yearly` "9,99 € / Jahr inkl. MwSt.", `premium-terms-yearly`, `premium-buy-yearly`) and Lifetime (`premium-card-lifetime`, `premium-price-lifetime`, `premium-buy-lifetime`), `lifetime-restore`, `premium-terms`, `premium-privacy`; only for a household known to have no premium, with the switch on and a price read.
- `iap-no-sdk-before-tap` (H-67): no RevenueCat SDK call before a tap on Buy or Restore, one store price read per page opening. Proven by `app/test/purchases/no_sdk_before_tap_test.dart` (the real repository over the SDK's mocked channel). On the web, `e2e/tests/purchases.spec.ts` and `premium-yearly.spec.ts` check no request goes to a RevenueCat host.
- `iap-prices`: the store's price exactly as returned (EUR with VAT line; USD, GBP, CHF without); a plan the store doesn't return is hidden (yearly-only storefronts); no price read: `premium-unavailable`, no Buy. Proven in `premium_screen_test.dart` and `store_prices_test.dart` (fakes; the native query compiles in CI's android and ios gates).
- `iap-switch`: `premium_offer` off: `lifetime-unavailable` ("bald verfügbar"), no card, no price query. Unreadable (offline): `premium-unavailable` ("gerade nicht verfügbar"), no price query (job 67).
- `iap-buy` buys, shows `lifetime-unlocking`, then the status tile `lifetime-unlocked` ("Hummlist Premium aktiv (jährlich, verlängert sich am …)" or "Hummlist Premium Lifetime"). After a minute without the unlock: `lifetime-unlock-delayed`.
- `iap-yearly-status`: renewing, "läuft am … aus" (auto-renew off), Lifetime, "über Tester-Freischaltung"; `premium-manage` ("Abo verwalten oder kündigen") while a yearly plan is active; on the web `premium-manage-web` with both store pages.
- `iap-billing-issue`: only the subscriber sees `premium-billing-issue`; other members see only the end date. The `CANCELLATION` (`BILLING_ERROR`) RevenueCat sends next to it keeps the grace end, in either order (job 67).
- `iap-lifetime-while-yearly`: Buy Lifetime while a plan renews opens `premium-lifetime-warning` (`premium-lifetime-warning-manage`, `-cancel`, `-buy`); afterwards the page shows `premium-lifetime-while-yearly`. The SDK starts only on `premium-lifetime-warning-buy`.
- `iap-two-yearly`: `premium-two-yearly` with the manage row.
- `iap-billing-continues` (H-85): before account deletion, a join that leaves the household (plain, delete, archive) and re-enabling an archived household: `premium-billing-continues` for the subscriber (`premium-billing-manage`, `premium-billing-continue`), `premium-billing-other` for other members of a billed household (`premium-billing-cancel`).
- `iap-partner` shows the unlock on the other member's client live, without a Buy button, and the More row's detail "Freigeschaltet" (`more-lifetime`).
- `iap-checking` shows `lifetime-checking` and no card while the household's rows are unknown.
- `iap-pending` shows `lifetime-pending` for Ask to Buy or a Play pending payment, until the unlock arrives.
- `iap-restore-lapsed`: Restore with only a lapsed plan says nothing to restore, and Buy stays (job 67; `revenuecat_repository_test.dart`).
- `iap-states` after a tap on Buy: `lifetime-canceled`, `lifetime-error`, `lifetime-unavailable` (product missing), `lifetime-offline`.
- `iap-elsewhere`: `lifetime-used-elsewhere` with the yearly hint (the store account pays a plan for another household).
- `iap-twice`: `lifetime-bought-twice` for two Lifetime purchases; `lifetime-refund-help` opens the refund help (`refund-help`, H-76 texts plus the yearly note).
- `iap-refund`: a refund (`CANCELLATION` with `CUSTOMER_SUPPORT`) locks that purchase; a yearly cancellation without refund keeps premium to the end.
- `iap-join`, `iap-archive`, `iap-tester`: as in job 43/47 (`join-target-unlocked`, `join-archive`, `archived-households`, tester grants; "unlocked" now means "has premium now").
- `iap-web`: `lifetime-web` ("Hummlist Premium kaufst du in der iPhone- oder Android-App. …"), no buy or restore button.

- `iap-integration-lock` (job 50): the lock in Zugänge. Only with the build define `INTEGRATION_LOCK` (fg: `FG_INTEGRATION_LOCK=1 fg up`), the server switch `integration_lock` on and a household known to have no premium: `integration-premium` with what is included, `integration-buy` (opens `/more/lifetime?from=integrations`) where the build sells and `premium_offer` is on, else `integration-soon` ("Bald verfügbar.") or on the web `integration-in-the-apps`; tokens and apps show `access-paused`. A purchase by any member removes the card within one sync. `paywall_viewed` (`entry_point` `more` or `integrations`) goes out when the page shows a plan with its price. Drive: `fg db query --write "update app_switches set enabled = true where key in ('integration_lock','premium_offer')"`, `fg tap --text Mehr`, `fg tap --key more-access`, `fg wait --key integration-premium`, `fg tap --key integration-buy`, `fg tap --key premium-buy-yearly`; on lea `fg wait --key integration-premium --gone --client lea`. Native screenshots: `SCREENSHOT_DIR=/tmp/shots flutter test --update-goldens test/settings/integration_lock_screenshots_test.dart`.
## How to get to it (user POV)

- Mehr → Hummlist Premium (`more-lifetime`, under Haushalt) → `/more/lifetime`. Only signed in and in a household (`authRedirect`).
- On a phone RevenueCat's SDK runs the store sheet and the native channel reads prices. Locally there is no store and no RevenueCat: fg builds carry the fake store (`FAKE_STORE`), whose prices are the launch prices in euros and whose purchases go to the local stack's `POST /purchases/test/event` and the real claim route.

## Driving it with fg

Preconditions:

- Run `scripts/iap-local-env.sh` before `fg up` (the webhook and `test/event` answer 503 without it; a running stack loads it only after `fg down` and `fg up`).
- Turn the offer switch on: `fg db query --write "update app_switches set enabled = true where key = 'premium_offer'"` (off: only "bald verfügbar").
- `FG_FAKE_STORE` at build time: `ok` (default), `pending`, `cancel`, `error`, `unavailable`, `offline`. On the Hetzner runner use `FG_SURFACE=linux`.

- **Offer.** On peter: `fg tap --key tab-more`, `fg marionette -- scroll-to --key more-lifetime`, `fg tap --key more-lifetime`, `fg wait --key premium-card-yearly`; `premium-card-lifetime` counts 1; `fg screenshot --name iap-offer`.
- **Buy yearly.** `fg tap --key premium-buy-yearly`, `fg wait --key lifetime-unlocked`. `fg db query --as peter "select premium_source, expires_at, auto_renew from entitlements"` shows `yearly`, a year ahead, `true`. `fg db query "select plan, expires_at, auto_renew, billing_issue from purchases order by verified_at desc limit 1"`.
- **Partner never sees yearly again.** On lea before and after: `premium-buy-yearly` counts 1, then 0; `premium-card-lifetime` stays.
- **Lifecycle.** Post to the local stand-in (ids from `fg db query "select bound_household, transaction_id from purchases"`): `curl -s -X POST "$(fg env | jq -r .apiUrl)/functions/v1/purchases/test/event" -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{"type":"CANCELLATION","cancelReason":"UNSUBSCRIBE","productId":"com.hummlist.app.yearly","appUserId":"<household>","transactionId":"<id>"}'` → `updated`, the tile says "läuft am … aus". `"type":"EXPIRATION","expiresInDays":-1` → premium off on both clients live, both cards back. `"type":"RENEWAL"` → back. `"type":"BILLING_ISSUE","graceDays":14` → only the subscriber sees `premium-billing-issue`. Then `"type":"CANCELLATION","cancelReason":"BILLING_ERROR","expiresInDays":-1` (RevenueCat's companion event, with the paid period's past end; without `expiresInDays` the local route sends a year ahead) → premium stays to the grace end (job 67). `eventAgoMs` sends an older event (`stale`).
- **Lifetime while yearly.** With the yearly plan active: `fg tap --key premium-buy-lifetime` → `premium-lifetime-warning`; `fg tap --key premium-lifetime-warning-buy` → after the unlock `premium-lifetime-while-yearly`.
- **Billing continues.** As the subscriber: Mehr → Konto → Konto löschen → `premium-billing-continues`; as lea: `premium-billing-other`.
- **Restore, pending, states, refund, elsewhere, twice, join, tester, web**: as before (`lifetime-restore`; `FG_FAKE_STORE=…`; `"type":"CANCELLATION"` with the default `CUSTOMER_SUPPORT`; the same `transactionId` for another household → `used_elsewhere`; a promotional grant: `fg db query --write "select public.promotional_premium_sync('<household>', true, null)"` as `e2e/tests/integration-lock.spec.ts` does; at RevenueCat it is `scripts/iap/promotional.ts grant`).
- **Proof.** `fg screenshot --name iap-<sub-feature>` per state, the `fg db query` rows, `fg record start/stop` across buy and partner. Native screenshots of every state: `SCREENSHOT_DIR=/tmp/shots flutter test --update-goldens test/purchases/screenshots_test.dart`.

## Gotchas

- Members can't `select *` from `entitlements` (H-55): name the columns; `granted_by` and `tester` are service-only.
- `household_premium()` / `household_has_premium()` are server-only; `fg db query` (service) can call them, `--as` a member cannot.
- `test/event` exists only on the local stack. The real webhook needs `REVENUECAT_WEBHOOK_AUTH` (locally `scripts/iap-local-env.sh`).
- Real store purchases and real store prices need RevenueCat, the stores and a build with `REVENUECAT_PURCHASES=true`; report them as not drivable here.
- A fake-store purchase is environment Sandbox and counts as internal in analytics.
