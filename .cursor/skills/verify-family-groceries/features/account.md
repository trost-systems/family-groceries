# Account (export and deletion)

Every signed-in user can export their data and delete their account. Both live on the Konto page (Mehr → Konto, route `/more/account`), which also shows the signed-in email address; the MCP server, tokens and connected apps are on the separate Zugänge page (`/more/access`, `features/mcp-access.md`); a user without a household also finds "Konto löschen" on the welcome screen. The deletion dialog says what happens to the household before anything is deleted, and deletes only after the user types `LÖSCHEN` (or `LOESCHEN`, or `DELETE` as the English app asks) and taps "Endgültig löschen". Afterwards the app shows the sign-in screen with "Dein Konto wurde gelöscht." A shared household stays for the other members with the deleted user's items, now without their name. A household whose last member deletes goes with everything in it. The user's feedback notes go with the account either way; other members' notes stay, without the deleted household's id.

## Sub-features

- `acct-entry` opens the Konto page (`account-screen`) from the More tab's entry "Konto" (key `menu-account`, route `/more/account`; the old link `/settings?section=account` redirects there), with the signed-in email (`account-email`), "Meine Daten exportieren" and "Konto löschen", and nothing of Zugänge.
- `acct-fate-kept` tells a member of a shared household that "Der Haushalt „<name>“ bleibt für <other members> mit der ganzen Liste erhalten."
- `acct-fate-deleted` tells the last member "Du bist das letzte Mitglied. Deshalb wird der Haushalt „<name>“ … gelöscht."
- `acct-confirm-word` keeps "Endgültig löschen" disabled until the field holds `LÖSCHEN`, `LOESCHEN` or `DELETE` (any case, spaces around ignored).
- `acct-delete-shared` deletes the account; the other member keeps the list and the deleted user's items lose their author (`added_by` null). The user can no longer sign in, and their access tokens get 401.
- `acct-delete-last` deletes the account and the household with its items, history, categories, stores, invites, learned memory, learned brands and tokens.
- `acct-offline` refuses without a connection ("Keine Internetverbindung. Dein Konto wurde nicht gelöscht. …") and deletes nothing.
- `acct-export` saves `einkauf-daten-YYYY-MM-DD.json` (format `family-groceries-export`) with the user's account, profile, household, the items they added (`items_added`, with brand and properties) and history, the invites they made, token names and hints, connected apps (OAuth grants with scopes and dates), their analytics answers, Alexa links, their own feedback notes (`feedback`, job 21) and purchases (`purchases`, job 25), plus `version` and `exported_at`; never a token hash. `jq keys` on the file lists access_tokens, account, alexa_links, analytics_decisions, connected_apps, exported_at, feedback, format, history, household, invites_created, items_added, profile, purchases, version. The snackbar says "Daten exportiert: <path>" on desktop.
- `acct-welcome` deletes an account that has no household from the welcome screen ("Du bist in keinem Haushalt, geteilte Daten gibt es nicht.").
- `acct-apple` asks Apple for a fresh authorization after the typed confirmation and revokes the Apple tokens (iOS only). Not drivable on the box: there is no iOS surface. Elsewhere the sign-in screen adds the hint to remove "Hummlist" from the Apple ID only when the server could not revoke.

## How to get to it (user POV)

- Tap "Mehr" in the tab bar, scroll down and tap "Konto". Zugänge is a separate page without these actions.
- Signed in without a household, the welcome screen shows "Konto löschen" below the onboarding form.
- The public page `/konto-loeschen.html` on the web build explains the steps for Google Play (published since job 33a: no ENTWURF banner, no noindex; contact support@hummlist.com, links the privacy policy).

## Driving it with fg

Preconditions:

- Baseline from `features/README.md`. Peter is signed in on the list.
- A short list, so the throwaway's item is on peter's screen: `fg db query "update items set status = 'bought' where status = 'active'" --write`.
- Note the member count before the join: `fg db query "select count(*) from household_members m join households h on h.id = m.household_id where h.name = 'Familie Test'"`. Earlier household recipes may have left extra members.
- Never delete the seeded peter or lea. The lea client hosts a throwaway user: run `fg logout --client lea`, then `fg type --key login-email --input konto-$(date +%s)@fg.test --client lea`, `fg type --key login-password --input test-password-123 --client lea`, `fg tap --text Registrieren --client lea` and `fg wait --key household-name --client lea`. Its display name is the part before `@`.

- **Journey: a throwaway member joins Familie Test, adds an item and deletes the account.**
  1. Invite as peter: `fg tap --key tab-more`, `fg wait --key more-invite`, `fg tap --key more-invite`, `fg wait --text Code`, read the code with `fg find --type Text | jq -r '[.elements[].text | select(test("^[A-Z2-9]{8}$"))][0]'`, then `fg back` and `fg tap --key tab-list`.
  2. Join as the throwaway: `fg type --key invite-code --input <code> --client lea`, `fg tap --text Beitreten --client lea`, `fg wait --text "FAMILIE TEST" --client lea`.
  3. Add an item: `I=Xylophon-$(date +%s)`, `fg type --key add-item-field --input $I --submit --client lea`, `fg wait --contains "Hinzugefügt: $I" --client lea`, then `fg press escape --client lea` (the open sheet takes the tabs away). On peter, `fg wait --text $I` succeeds. Read its id with `fg db query "select id, added_by from items where name = '$I'"`. It returns lea's id.
  4. `acct-entry`: `fg tap --key tab-more --client lea`, `fg wait --key more-screen --client lea`, `fg marionette --client lea -- scroll-to --key menu-account`, `fg tap --key menu-account --client lea`, `fg wait --key account-delete --client lea`. Screenshot `acct-entry-settings`.
  5. `acct-fate-kept`: `fg tap --key account-delete --client lea`, `fg wait --key account-delete-confirm-field --client lea`, `fg wait --contains "bleibt für" --client lea`. The sentence names the other members, in any order, joined with "und".
  6. `acct-confirm-word`: `fg tap --key account-delete-confirm --client lea`, then `fg wait --key account-delete-dialog --client lea` still succeeds (the disabled button did nothing). `fg type --key account-delete-confirm-field --input LÖSCHEN --client lea`. Screenshot `acct-confirm-dialog`.
  7. `acct-delete-shared`: `fg tap --key account-delete-confirm --client lea`, `fg wait --key account-deleted-notice --client lea` (text "Dein Konto wurde gelöscht."). Screenshot `acct-deleted-sign-in`.
  8. Peter, without reload: `fg wait --text $I` succeeds. Screenshot `acct-partner-list-after`.
  9. Database: `fg db query "select count(*) from auth.users where email = '<throwaway email>'"` returns 0. `fg db query "select added_by from items where name = '$I'"` returns null. The member count query returns the count from before the join.
  10. Sign-in refused: `fg type --key login-email --input <throwaway email> --client lea`, `fg type --key login-password --input test-password-123 --client lea`, `fg tap --text Anmelden --client lea` (the button, not the app bar title), `fg wait --contains "Anmeldung fehlgeschlagen" --client lea`.
- **Tokens die with the account.** Before step 7, create a token for the throwaway in its settings ("Token erstellen", see `features/mcp-access.md`). After step 7, a POST to `$(fg env | jq -r .apiUrl)/functions/v1/voice` with `Authorization: Bearer <token>` returns 401, and `fg db query "select count(*) from personal_access_tokens where name = '<token name>'"` returns 0.
- **`acct-delete-last`.** With a fresh throwaway on the welcome screen: `fg type --key household-name --input "WG Konto" --client lea`, `fg tap --text "Haushalt anlegen" --client lea`, `fg type --key add-item-field --input Milch --submit --client lea`, `fg wait --contains "Hinzugefügt: Milch" --client lea`, `fg press escape --client lea`. Note the id from `fg db query "select id from households where name = 'WG Konto'"`. Open the dialog as in steps 4 and 5; `fg wait --contains "Du bist das letzte Mitglied" --client lea`. Type `LÖSCHEN`, confirm, `fg wait --key account-deleted-notice --client lea`. Then `fg db query "select (select count(*) from households where id = '<id>') + (select count(*) from items where household_id = '<id>') + (select count(*) from categories where household_id = '<id>') + (select count(*) from stores where household_id = '<id>') + (select count(*) from item_events where household_id = '<id>') as left"` returns 0. `journeys/account-deletion.sh` checks all 12 tables that carry the household (members, invites, store orders, both memories, tokens and learned brands too; it gives the item a brand first so the household learns one).
- **`acct-welcome`.** With a fresh throwaway on the welcome screen: `fg tap --key account-delete --client lea`, `fg wait --contains "Du bist in keinem Haushalt" --client lea`, `fg type --key account-delete-confirm-field --input LÖSCHEN --client lea`, `fg tap --key account-delete-confirm --client lea`, `fg wait --key account-deleted-notice --client lea`.
- **`acct-export`.** As peter (export reads only): `fg tap --key tab-more`, `fg wait --key more-screen`, `fg marionette -- scroll-to --key menu-account`, `fg tap --key menu-account`, `fg wait --key account-export`, `fg tap --key account-export`, `fg wait --contains "Daten exportiert"`. The snackbar text ends in the file path. `jq '.format, .account.email' <path>` prints `"family-groceries-export"` and `"peter@fg.test"`, `jq '.feedback | length' <path>` counts peter's notes (`features/feedback.md`), and `grep -c token_hash <path>` prints 0.
- **Cancel.** In the dialog, `fg tap --key account-delete-cancel --client lea` closes it and `fg wait --key account-delete-dialog --gone --client lea` succeeds. The user still exists.
- **`acct-offline`.** fg cannot take a client offline yet, so this is not drivable here. Report it as skipped on this surface. The web e2e test "offline, deletion is refused and the account stays; back online it goes through" (`e2e/tests/account.spec.ts`) covers it.
- **`acct-apple`.** iOS only. Report it as skipped on the box.
- **Proof.** Screenshots `acct-entry-settings`, `acct-confirm-dialog`, `acct-deleted-sign-in` (lea) and `acct-partner-list-after` (peter), a recording across steps 5 to 8 (`fg record start --name acct-delete-shared --client lea`), and the step 9 query outputs.

## Gotchas

- Never delete the seeded peter or lea. Deleting lea (or peter) breaks the baseline, and only `fg up --fresh` restores it. Use a throwaway user on the lea client.
- Deleting the last member deletes the household. Never let a throwaway that created its own household stand in for a test of the shared case.
- On the Linux desktop the export writes the file to the Downloads folder (`xdg-user-dir DOWNLOAD`), or to the temp directory when there is none: on the build box that is `/tmp/einkauf-daten-<date>.json`. Read the path from the snackbar instead of guessing it, and delete the file afterwards; it holds the user's email.
- More is a lazy list: scroll to `menu-account` before tapping it. Konto is a route below `/more`, so `fg back` returns to the More list (job 29d; before, it closed the Linux app).
- The dialog loads the household's fate from the server first. Wait for `account-delete-confirm-field` before typing; until then the dialog shows a spinner.
- Button labels inside the dialog ("Endgültig löschen", "Abbrechen") are not listed by `fg find`. Use the keys `account-delete-confirm` and `account-delete-cancel`.
- `account-delete` is the key on both the Konto page's tile and the welcome screen button.
- `--as lea` in `fg db query` means the seeded lea, not the throwaway signed in on the lea client.
- A fresh partner item's text carries the semantics label "<name>\nNeu" (job 8). Marionette prints it across two lines; `fg` before job 9 failed every `find`/`wait` on such a screen with "Unterminated string in JSON". Fixed in `cli/marionette.ts` (`parseElements`).
- `journeys/account-deletion.sh` runs this whole recipe (shared and last-member deletion, export) and prints `PASS` or `FAIL: <step>`. Clean throwaways from aborted runs with `fg db query "delete from auth.users where email like 'konto-%@fg.test'" --write`.
