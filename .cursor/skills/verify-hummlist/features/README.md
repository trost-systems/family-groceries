# Hummlist feature map

This directory is the maintained record of what Hummlist does today, one file per user-facing feature. Agents use it to verify behavior on the web build with the verify-hummlist skill. Writers use [FEATURES-FOR-WRITERS.md](./FEATURES-FOR-WRITERS.md), the plain-language version for emails, site copy and instructions. A PR that changes user-facing behavior updates the feature file and FEATURES-FOR-WRITERS.md (including its last-verified line) in the same PR.

## Baseline preconditions

- Your checkout's `supabase/config.toml` has your job's port block and project id (local only, skip-worktree; COORDINATION.md). Helpers refuse the canonical 543xx block.
- `helpers/launch.sh` printed `READY http://127.0.0.1:<prefix>81 run=<run>`. The stack runs with every migration applied, the release web build of this checkout is served there, and the run seeded the `demo-familie` scenario.
- `helpers/doctor.sh` exits 0.
- Baseline household „Familie Brandt“: members Mia, Noah and Ida Brandt (`member(inst, 'mia' | 'noah' | 'ida')` in `helpers/lib.mjs`, emails `<handle>.<run>@fg-test.invalid`, passwords only in the run file `~/.cache/verify-hummlist/<prefix>/fg/runs/<run>.json`, mode 600). Stores dm, Lidl and Edeka with their walk orders and the 11 seeded categories. 13 open items, none tagged to a store: „6× Bananen“, „1 kg Äpfel“, „4× Brötchen“, „2× Vollmilch“, Butter, Nudeln, Reis, Schokolade, Mineralwasser, Apfelsaft, Erbsen, Spülmittel, Zahnpasta. No purchase history, so nothing is due yet.
- English: `launch.sh --scenario demo-family-en` („Brandt family“, English item names). The app follows the browser locale while its language is „Wie Gerät“; `openApp(inst, { lang: 'en' })` sets `en-US`.
- Other states (heavy history with due items, many stores, a pending invite, a user without a household): `launch.sh --scenario <name>` with any `test/fixtures/scenarios/` file (`docs/TEST_FIXTURES.md`).
- A new install is asked the analytics question after sign-in. `signIn` in `helpers/lib.mjs` declines it and dismisses the explainer card („Verstanden“).
- Never drive an instance this run did not start, another job's stack, or the hosted project.

## Driving conventions

- Start every recipe from the baseline unless its preconditions say otherwise. `launch.sh --fresh` reseeds the baseline (new run, old run torn down).
- Find widgets by ARIA role and accessible name. Semantics are on in the web build. Rows, chips and menu entries are buttons whose name joins label and hint ("Läden Reihenfolge und Laufweg"), so match names with a start-anchored regex.
- Labels in recipes are German (the browser locale is de-DE). For English runs, look labels up by ARB key with `labels('en')` instead of translating by hand.
- Type with `typeInto` (focus first, then insert text). Synthetic key events drop umlauts.
- A snackbar with an action keeps its text in a group's aria-label: find it with `actionSnackBar(page, '<text>')` (e2e helpers). `getByText` hits the screen-reader copy that the engine soon clears.
- The list builds rows lazily. Scroll with `reveal` (e2e helpers) or the mouse wheel before looking for a row far down.
- Set preconditions through the API (`apiAs` in `helpers/lib.mjs`) or `scripts/fg db query --write`. Prove the behavior under test only through the UI.
- Helper names in recipes (`addField`, `itemRow`, `addSheet`, `editSheet`, `openTab`, `openMore`, `tick`, `putBack`, `openEdit`, `pickInSheet`, `saveEdit`, `cutOff`, `signUpWithHousehold`, `createInviteCode`, `joinWithCode`, `answerConsent`) come from `e2e/tests/helpers.ts`. Journeys use the JS copies in `helpers/lib.mjs` where they exist.
- Each file names the e2e specs that already cover the feature. Run them with `scripts/verify.sh --only e2e -- tests/<file>`. That builds the e2e web build (`app/config/e2e.json`, which turns on LEGAL_DRAFTS, HOUSEHOLD_ARCHIVE and INTEGRATION_LOCK) and runs under `/tmp/fg-e2e.lock`.

## Proof and skip reporting

- Capture the user action and the resulting state: `capture(page, dir, name)` before and after (PNG plus ARIA snapshot), and the context's video across the action.
- A mutation needs a second, read-only view of the stored value: `apiAs(inst, user)` as a member, or a second browser context for sync.
- Record the feature id and the entry point with every artifact. `drive.sh` names the evidence dir `<run>/<feature-id>-<time>/`.
- Report an unreachable path with the command you attempted and the unmet precondition. Native iOS and Android, Siri on a device and Alexa on a device cannot be driven on a box without simulators. Their files say what the server side offers instead.
- Do not report a skipped entry point as verified through a different path.
- A claim nobody could prove is marked `unverified` with its reason, in the feature file and in FEATURES-FOR-WRITERS.md.

## Feature entry contract

Each feature file starts with an H1 title and one paragraph describing the user-visible behavior. It then uses exactly four H2 sections in this order.

1. `Sub-features` lists short IDs with one line for each behavior.
2. `How to get to it (user POV)` lists every user entry point, with the exact labels as „DE“ / "EN".
3. `Driving it with Playwright` starts with `Preconditions:` and uses labeled bullets that pair each user action with an exact locator or command and its observable result.
4. `Gotchas` lists traps that can waste or invalidate a verification run, gated behavior, and unverified claims with their reason.

Keep implementation details out of the map. Name only user paths, stable handles, required state, commands and observable proof. Feature ids are the file names; they are stable, so rename one only together with every link to it.
