# Links into the app (app.snacklist.app, app.hummlist.com)

A link to `https://app.snacklist.app/<path>` or `https://app.hummlist.com/<path>` opens that screen of Snacklist: in the installed iPhone or Android app when there is one, otherwise in the web app, with the same result. The paths are the list (`/list`), the add sheet (`/add`), one store's section (`/stores/<store id>`), the More tab (`/more`) and its pages (`/more/invites`, `/more/settings` and the others), and invites (`/join/<code>`). Any other path opens the list. Signed out, the link waits through sign-in (and, for an account without a household, through onboarding) and then opens its screen. The route table is `docs/DEEP_LINKS.md`.

## Sub-features

- `al-list` `/list` opens the list; the address becomes `/`.
- `al-add` `/add` opens the list with the add sheet open (group „Hinzufügen“ / "Add") and the field „Was brauchst du?“ / "What do you need?" focused; the address becomes `/`.
- `al-store` `/stores/<store id>` opens the list scrolled so that store's divider („<Store>, N Artikel“) is in view, unfolded if it was folded (the fold is then off for good, as after a tap). An id the household does not have, or a store without open items, opens the list as it is. On a start whose saved copy of the list lacks the store (its items came while the app was closed), the list waits for the first answer from the server and decides then; with no answer (offline, server errors) it stays as it is.
- `al-more` `/more`, `/more/invites` („Einladungen“), `/more/settings` („Einstellungen“), `/more/settings/language`, `/more/access` („Zugänge“), `/more/account` („Konto“), `/more/lifetime` (Premium page), `/more/usage-data` („Nutzungsdaten“; its row in Mehr shows only in builds with an analytics key), `/more/join` (the join-code page), `/more/household` (the household page, its row named after the household) and `/more/tips` („Tipps“) open that page of the More tab; back goes to More. `/more/legal` (a former page) lands on `/more`.
- `al-join` `/join/<code>` opens the join screen with the code in the phone apps. On the web it is the static join page (job 169b W2, household-invites `join-page`): who invites to which household, and „Im Browser beitreten“, which opens the app at `/?invite=<code>` and so the join screen (`link-join`).
- `al-unknown` any other path, signed in, opens the list. Signed out it opens the start screen of the guided start (`/start`, feature onboarding) without carrying the path, as `/` does. (Signed in, `/edit` and `/edit/<store id|none>` (Liste → Anpassen), `/join` and `/settings` open their own screens; they are not app links, so signed out they are dropped.)
- `al-signed-out` signed out, a link above opens „Anmelden“ with `?next=<path>` in the address (an invite, `/?invite=<code>` on the web, instead gives `/login?invite=<code>`, which survives an app kill); after sign-in (and the usage-data question on a new device) the link's screen opens.
- `al-no-household` an account without a household goes through „Willkommen bei Snacklist“ and creating or joining a household, with `?next=` in the address on every step of the guided start („Mit wem“ to „Was fehlt gerade?“, then the setup), and then lands on the link's screen instead of the invite step.
- `al-sign-out` signing out never carries the current page: „Abmelden“, the last row of Mehr, ends on plain `/login` (not the start screen).
- `al-root-signed-out` signed out, `/` (and any path that is no app link) opens the start screen `/start` with „Los geht's“, „Schon ein Konto? Anmelden“ and „Einladung einfügen“; with a guided start under way on the device, its step (`/start/<step>`).
- `al-apps` on the iPhone and Android apps the same paths open the app instead of the browser (universal links, App Links). `/`, the sign-in pages, onboarding and the MCP consent page always stay in the browser.

## How to get to it (user POV)

- Tap an app.snacklist.app or app.hummlist.com link in an email, a message or a web page (for example the onboarding email's link to „Einladungen“).
- In a browser: type or paste the address.

## Driving it with Playwright

Preconditions:

- Baseline household signed in (`signIn` in `helpers/lib.mjs`) for the signed-in recipes; a fresh browser context for the signed-out ones. For the store recipe add a store and tag an item first: `const mia = member(inst, 'mia'); const api = await apiAs(inst, mia); await api.rpc('add_store', { p_household: mia.householdId, p_name: 'Supermarkt' })`, then `.from('items').update({ store_id }).eq('name', 'Nudeln')`; store ids come from `.from('stores').select('id, name')`.

- **Add sheet.** `page.goto('/add')`. Observable: URL ends in `/`, `addSheet(page, L)` visible, `addField(page, L)` focused (the `helpers/lib.mjs` versions take the labels).
- **Store.** Fold Supermarkt with `storeDivider(page, 'Supermarkt').click()`, then `page.goto('/stores/<supermarkt id>')`. Observable: URL `/`, `storeDivider(page, 'Supermarkt')` in the viewport, its items visible again.
- **More page.** `page.goto('/more/invites')`. Observable: URL stays `/more/invites`, button „Neue Einladung“ visible; „Zurück“ goes to `/more`.
- **Unknown.** `page.goto('/does/not/exist')`. Observable: URL `/`, the add field visible, no add sheet.
- **Signed out.** In a fresh context `page.goto('/more/invites')`. Observable: URL `/login?next=/more/invites` (the same for `/more/household`: `/login?next=/more/household`, driven 2026-11-09). Sign in with „Weiter mit E-Mail“, „E-Mail“, „Passwort“, „Anmelden“, answer the usage-data question (`answerConsent`): URL `/more/invites`.
- **Without a household.** `signUp(page, email, '/more/settings')`: URL `/welcome?next=/more/settings`; „Haushalt erstellen“, then on the guided start „Überspringen“ (Mit wem), „Weiter“ (name), „Überspringen“ (stores), „Weiter“ („Was fehlt gerade?“), each step's URL carrying `?next=`. `e2e/tests/deep-links.spec.ts` ("a signed-out link survives onboarding for a new account") expects `/more/settings` at the end.
- **Signed out at `/`.** Fresh context, `page.goto('/')` or `page.goto('/does/not/exist')`. Observable: URL `/start`, button „Los geht's“.
- **Specs.** `e2e/tests/deep-links.spec.ts`; router cases in `app/test/app/router_test.dart`; the domain files in `app/test/app/deep_links_config_test.dart`. Run with `scripts/verify.sh --only e2e -- tests/deep-links.spec.ts`.

## Gotchas

- `page.goto` reloads the web app, as a tapped link does. Wait for the target screen before the next `goto`.
- `al-apps` cannot be driven on a box without simulators. The domain files are checked by `deep_links_config_test.dart`, the live ones by `node e2e/web-smoke.mjs https://app.snacklist.app` (or `https://app.hummlist.com`). app.hummlist.com serves the new association file since the store upload of 6 Nov (`docs/DEEP_LINKS.md`, "Rollout"). Since the Snacklist test uploads of 10 Nov both hosts' files list `com.snacklist.app` and `com.hummlist.app` (assetlinks and AASA read on 2026-11-11). web-smoke itself stops earlier, at `/join/ABC123`: it still expects the Flutter index there, but since 169b that path is the static join page, so read the association files with `curl` instead. Whether iOS picked it up and the new paths open the iPhone app is unverified on a device.
- Both hosts serve the `release` branch, which moves to main with every TestFlight and Play internal upload; since the uploads of 6 Nov it has job 66 (#188). The web app there and test builds from 6 Nov on route every path here. There is no public store release yet (`releases/releases.json`); a phone app built before 6 Nov opens the plain list for `/list`, `/add` and `/stores/<id>`. The recipes here prove main's web build.
- A sign-in that leaves the phone app (magic link, Apple on Android) keeps the link only while the app stays in memory; after the app is killed it opens the list. Invites survive (`link-join`).
- `/settings` (without `/more`) is the old address of Zugänge and Konto; it still works but does not open the phone app.
