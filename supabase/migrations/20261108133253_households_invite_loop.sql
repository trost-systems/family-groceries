-- Job 169b wave 2: the invite loop (docs/households/W2.md). Person invites (any member, 7 days, one
-- use) and group links (owner and admins, 30 days, 50 uses, one open per household) count their
-- uses under the invite's row lock; every join is a row in invite_uses. Owners name admins, owners
-- and admins remove members (only a newer invite of the owner or an admin lets them back in), and
-- ownership passes on whenever the owner goes. A signed-out join page previews a code through
-- preview_invite_public, rate-limited per hashed client and per code.
