# it that way: every gate has a ci.yml job of its name that runs it and is in ci-ok's needs, and
# is listed in verify.sh; no check command is written into ci.yml or verify.sh directly. Every
# job in every workflow also sets timeout-minutes, and the on-demand e2e.yml sets up its db and
# e2e jobs exactly like ci.yml's (job 27).
