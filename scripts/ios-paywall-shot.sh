# Job 86: the App Store in-app purchase review screenshot. The Premium page as the integration lock
# opens it (PW-P4, test_driver/paywall_review.dart, debug build) with the yearly plan and Lifetime at
# the German storefront's prices (9,99 EUR a year, 29,99 EUR once), once with each plan picked and its
# Buy button (out.png and out-lifetime.png). German, light,
# on a 6.7" iPhone simulator (1290x2796), status bar at 9:41. The page asks StoreKit through its
# real channel; the script prints that answer and fails unless StoreKit returned both products.
# Nothing is bought and no server is called. Needs macOS with Xcode; run by
# .github/workflows/paywall-shot.yml. Usage: ios-paywall-shot.sh [out.png]
