# Runs the CI gates (scripts/gates/<gate>.sh, the same scripts the ci.yml jobs run) locally and
# stops at the first that fails. The last line is the verdict in plain text: the gates that
# passed, or the gate that failed and the file its output is in, so `| tail` still shows it.
# Each run of a gate writes its own file (VERIFY_LOG_DIR, by default verify/ in the checkout's
# git dir): <gate>.<time>.<pid>.<n>.log, the newest five kept and those of runs still going,
# <gate>.log a link to the newest.
# Usage: scripts/verify.sh [--only <gate>[,<gate>...]] [--skip-e2e] [--screenshots <dir>] [-- <playwright args>]
#   --only e2e -- tests/list.spec.ts   runs one spec file under the box-wide e2e lock
#        scripts/verify.sh --history [<since>]   runs, failures, seconds and flakes per gate, from
#                                                the ledger; <since> is a date like 2026-11-14
#
# Every gate run is a row in the ledger (VERIFY_LEDGER, by default verify-ledger.tsv in the
# clone's .git, which its worktrees share): time, branch, tree, gate, result, seconds, arguments,
# seconds waited. The seconds leave out what the gate says it "waited N s for the lock".
# The tree is the hash of the working tree as it is: uncommitted and untracked files and the
# skip-worktree and assume-unchanged ones (the port block in supabase/config.toml) included,
# ignored files (.env files, build output) not. A gate with both results on one tree and the
# same arguments is a flake by that definition, and the run that sees one says so (docs/CI.md,
# "The local loop").
