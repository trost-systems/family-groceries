-- Job 50: which households the integration lock would lock when app_switches.integration_lock
-- goes on (docs/NEEDS_LEAD.md "Job 50"). Read-only: one SELECT, nothing written. It uses the
-- server's own rule (household_has_premium, job 49), so a promotional grant (testers) or an active plan counts
-- exactly as the endpoints count it.
--
-- Run it in the Supabase SQL editor (or psql as postgres) of the project you want to know about:
--   psql "$DB_URL" -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 -f scripts/iap/integration-cutover.sql
-- One row per household that would be locked AND uses an integration now, then a total line.
-- No names, emails or list contents: ids, counts and dates only.
