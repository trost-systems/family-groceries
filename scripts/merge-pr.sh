#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Lands a PR on main as one commit authored with the required noreply email.
# GitHub's squash merge authors the commit with the account's default email
# and rejects the noreply address as --author-email, so the squash happens
# locally and the single commit is rebase-merged, which keeps its author.
#
# Usage: scripts/merge-pr.sh [--wait] [--dry-run] <pr-number>
#   Pushed with scripts/push-pr.sh, the PR head is already that one commit: this checks ci-ok
#   on it and rebase-merges it (with --wait, it first waits for ci-ok to finish).
#   Otherwise (pushed with plain git push), it squashes the PR, force-pushes the PR branch and
#   exits 2: wait for ci-ok on the new head, then rerun. That costs a second CI run.
#   If main moved since the push, the head is no longer on top of main: rerun
#   scripts/push-pr.sh (one rebase, one push, one CI run), then this.
#   Run right after a push, it waits (up to 2 min) until GitHub's record of the PR names the
#   pushed head.
#   If the PR description changed since that push, it stops: rerun scripts/push-pr.sh, which
#   lands the current description.
#   --dry-run checks everything and stops before the merge.
#   --wait gives up after MERGE_WAIT_MINUTES (whole minutes, default 30), so a ci-ok that never
#   reports can't hold the merge lock forever.
#   A signal that ends only the wait's sleep (a kill by name elsewhere on the machine) does not
#   end the wait: it is logged and the wait goes on, up to 20 times.
